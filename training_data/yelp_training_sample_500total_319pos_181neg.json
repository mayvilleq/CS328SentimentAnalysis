You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.\n\nI'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong. \n\nLa Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nBut one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it. \n\nPerfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.\n\nOn this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.\n\nSeriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West. If you're looking for authenticity, you've got a ton of other way-better options in this city.", "stars": 1, "cool": 1, "useful": 3, "date": "2011-08-28"}, {"user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "review_id": "En1MNI1OIEBxvAAmmWjQMg", "funny": 1, "business_id": "rROS_gXxt9UbD7peptH3vA", "text": "If the word 'bulk' conjers up images of dusty old ethnic shop food bins or soulless Bulk Barns, then you need to check out Nuthouse for a second opinion. Sitting in a little space out in the Bloor and Lansdowne, Nuthouse has established itself with Blansdowne locals as the best place around to pick up all sorts of interesting products.\n\nFirst thing you'll notice about Nuthouse is that it smells good...it smells really good...it smells like an incredibly nice mix of high-quality nuts, cereals, grains, teas, dried fruit, lentils, dried fruit, spices, cake, and coffee. It's a smell that right away makes you feel comfortable and assures you that what you're getting is filled with quality. Don't expect to see the typical bulk fare with hundreds of bins full of overly processed and mass-produced stuff; you're in the wrong place for that sorta thing. Nuthouse is full of nothing but always high quality and sometimes organic products.\n\nOk. That might not be the very first thing you notice. Chances are, if you're walking down Bloor looking for this place, or even if you're not looking for it, the first thing you'll notice won't even be inside the store; it'll be the big, plastic walnut hanging above the front doorway. That big walnut has become somewhat of a landmark item on this stretch of Bloor, even though they've only been in business for a few months.\n\nNuthouse isn't just about nuts. They carry all sorts of things, from organic candy and fair-trade coffee to raw cereals and handmade soap. And its healthy too. A lot of the stuff they carry is the sugar-free, vegan, raw, organic type of stuff, which makes it a super option for more health conscious people. And if you have dietary restrictions, Nuthouse has got you covered too with tons of gluten and wheat free products, like their spiced carrot cake. If that's your bag and you live in the area, you no longer need to travel far to get these kinda things.\n\nPersonally, when I think of organic or locally-sourced or handmade or any other related adjective used to describe stuff in a store like this, I unfortunately also think 'expensive'. At Nuthouse though, that really isn't the case. The prices are actually fairly down-to-earth and mostly afforable. In fact, a lot of the products they sell are actually cheaper than the bulk stuff you find at No Frills, with an obvious element of quality you may not find at bigger places. \n\nWanting to try out interesting varieties of stuff you already love, like lentils or rice or yes, even nuts? Nuthouse has got you covered. They carry a ton of different kinds, some of which you probably didn't even know existed. And that brings up one of the best things about buying in bulk in a place like this: you can buy in smaller amounts purely just because you want to try something. Buying in bulk doesn't have to be about being able to get more for less, it's about being able to also get, well, just less. The fact that Nuthouse just happens to make it also affordable is just the icing on the organic carrot cake.", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2011-05-01"}, {"user_id": "oFCJsJqBZxqpBHZ7rD-lDw", "review_id": "wXpKZXh4pyd3gwvYOA1PJA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "ZlYjeK5S9hw1bP3nLezD6Q", "text": "i got a pair of  loupes from snap on optics.  i love them, they are light and very well designed.

Today was my first and last time coming here.\nLet's start with my experience with scheduling the appointment. I called the salon and was answered by a man's voice with a simple, \"Hello?\" I wasn't sure if I dialed the correct number since that was the only thing he said. I asked if it was Binh's Hair Salon and he replied with \"Yeah.\" As that should have been my sign to just hang up and schedule elsewhere, I proceeded to give the business the benefit of the doubt and asked if I could schedule an appointment. The man said, \"Yeah, sure,\" and hung up as soon as I said my requested date and time.\nSo, the appointment day came and I arrived early. When it was my turn, the woman at the desk told me I could sit in the next available chair. I asked if I could get my hair washed prior to my haircut and she quickly said, \"You can or you don't have to, it's five dollars extra if you want your hair washed,\" and I said yes that's fine. She responded in a way as if it were an inconvenience for her to wash my hair as she directed me to the sink.\nFast forward to the hair cut: as he was cutting my hair, he kept looking away and glancing at the door as he snipped my hair!! My hair ended up looking choppy and uneven. I was so upset with the results, but I didn't want to cause a scene and just paid quickly in order to leave asap.The woman's demeanor quickly changed and she was all of sudden super nice and polite as I pulled out my payment.\nIf you're wondering, no it has nothing to do with the language barrier, because I'm Vietnamese as well! They were just incredibly rude and unprofessional. Poor quality hair cut and poor attitudes. I thought the other reviews were more honest, but I think it's inaccurate.

The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy. But the biggest disappointment was the hakka dishes, which are a signature Indo-Chinese noodle dish.  These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.\n\nWe wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants. We had to order a couple of extra entrees since some of us were still hungry, whereas we almost never can finish our food at other restaurants.\n\nThe service was competent bordering on perfunctory.

This was the second time I came here, and each time was a HUGE disappointment. I am never returning. EVER. The vet's name is Melissa Schupp. \n\n First, I arrived around 2:35 on a Sunday afternoon. I called two hours ahead of time to schedule an appointment because I knew Sundays would be busy; this is because many other animal hospitals are not open on Sundays. My dog was suffering from unknown allergic reactions with skin rashes left and right. I had just adopted him, and his skin had recently become infected and rotten-smelling.\n I called ahead of time, gave my details , a $77 quote and they reserved a room for me. When I arrived  the room was already reserved and I was led straight in. I initially thought I was going to have a great experience because of the quick room preparation but BOY was I wrong. When I was led into the room that was \"prepared,\" there was water all over the floor and the front desk lady hastily used paper towels to clean it up. I waited the standard 30 minutes in the smelly room until the nurse came into to check details, run temperature and give my dog a general physical. Then she left for AN HOUR. By this time it  was already 3:35, and my dog was whining from pain and discomfort in a closed off room. When the nurse returned and began to write down symptoms, my dog actually started peeing on floor. I didn't know what to do because I had no cleaning materials with me, so the nurse stepped into action and dropped a few paper towels on the ground. She didn't manage to soak up all the urine, so when she moved around, my dog was pushed into it and it ended all over my clothes when she asked for my to carry my dog onto the checkup table.\n\nTo make things worse, she left again for another hour, and checked in after the 40 minute mark to tell me the veterinarian would be with me after 1 minute. Ten more minutes passed and no one came. My dog was whimpering more and more at this point. Finally at 4:30, the vet comes in, smiling and kind, and asking me for doggie symptoms. I ask her about fleas, but I swear, this place was so profit driven that the VET DID NOT EVEN CHECK MY DOG FOR FLEAS BEFORE GIVING ME A PRESCRIPTION ON MY FLEA MEDICATION. The mere mention of \"I think my dog might have fleas but I don't know how to check for them\" initiated a conditioned response \"I'll prescribe flea medication\" WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE DOG. I asked kindly to hint to her that my dog might not have fleas because the itchiness could be a symptom of allergies. She then shows me how to check for fleas, but doesn't find any as she shows me. She continued to write down a prescription for fleas on my bill without my knowing. Is this a professional business? How can they cheat people like this!\nAs I continued to ask questions to make sure what my dog had, the nurse seemed to reply with more things to run up my medical bill. She gave my dog a unnecessary skin scrape for mites TWICE even though SHE SAID that it didn't seem like my dog had mites, she performed and charged me for the scrape all the same. Because I had never needed to have these operations performed, I did not know that it was an extra $30 to have skin scraped. She went to look at the scrapes under the microscope, and returned another hour later. By this time, it was 5:30 and my patience was running low. For three hours, I sat in a stuffy room, covered in urine and staring at my miserable dog scratching his skin to bloody scabby bits as the doctors and nurses neglected the both of us. Honestly, I was so frustrated, I didn't even know what to do.  I had never experienced such a horrible medical visit. \n\nAround 5:35 when she returned, she apologized for being gone for an hour, and she said she had to look over a pet with a \"real emergency.\" I'm not here to disqualify her statement, because I understand that this is a real animal hospital and that other people may have pets who are dying. But I also understand that this is a FOR-PROFIT animal hospital, and if they don't even have enough vets to go around that I have to wait three hours for something that takes less than 50 minutes, I truly will never EVER recommend this place or ever set foot near this place again.\n After she came back, she confirmed my dog had no mites, and gave me a pet \"cone of shame\" that I had asked for earlier. She told me it was $15 cone, and gave me flea medication and antibiotics for the infection. She hardly looked at my pet. The only part of the visit that was clear to my mind was that she kept saying \"ow\" when my dog nibbled at her fingers.\nI excitedly hurried out and paid my bill. EXCEPT IT WAS $207. I let the vet CUT MY DOG for $32, the flimsy cone was $30 in addition to the $29 un-needed flea meds. I cried.\nI think my only mistake was coming to this hospital. Be wary of coming here as the more questions you ask to get a better idea of your dog's condition, the more services and products they try to shove down your throat to earn revenue.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 10, "date": "2014-07-28"}, {"user_id": "KLLBg8pTzjiD1nWUHsjMAA", "review_id": "E3odDjdSoFAU-_m1FvXSRA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "yqYtY3-Po4OVPafA9Z-Xyw", "text": "Went here and was somewhat disappointed.

The menu is a full three panel - front and back - array of original creations, ranging from the unique and beautiful Lazy Sundaes to the Scoop du Jour - one or two scoops with cream and cherries.  Of course, you can also just select from the many offered toppings and ice cream flavours to create-your-own.  Ice cream includes peanut butter, nutello chocolate (not to be confused with Nutella) and vanilla-honey, amongst others.  On top of that, they throw in a freshly made crepe or waffle, some bananas or strawberries, chocolate sauce and a couple of dollops of the clearly-in-house-made whipped cream, and you have a dessert that will put you in a delightful sugar coma!\n\nIt was close to 11:00 p.m. when I made my way to Demetre's, but there were still a good number of sweet-toothed patrons enjoying some of the sugary creations - this was clearly be more than your regular two-scoop waffle-cone kind of place.  They make all of the ice creams on the premises, using fresh Ontario dairy and utilizing a special freezing process that prevents ice crystals from forming in the carefully crafted artisan frozen treats.\n\nThe servings provide you more than enough ice cream and extras to share comfortably, but my group decided to be gluttonous and each have their own; three ice cream crepe dishes, one with peanut butter ice cream, one nutello chocolate and one with the house chocolate.  The best thing about these desserts, right down to the whipped cream, is the balance of sweetness with the bold flavours.  There is a truly special way they do things that prevents the strong flavours from overwhelming the whole dish.  The peanut butter ice cream was nowhere near that almost sticky consistency and too-rich taste that can be attached to some PB creations; the whipped cream was a clean and creamy compliment to the light chocolate syrup; and the fruit was fresh and surprisingly bright considering the winter months.\n\nI am a self-proclaimed cheap dessert-eater, but here I felt like I got much more than I paid for.  The dishes come in at about $10 each - but, if you're sharing, which is probably more appropriate than polishing off a whole plate alone, it is quite affordable - especially for the top-notch quality.\n\nThe cherry on top was the service.

Make reservations. Since it opened, this place has gotten great buzz for providing authentic, flavourful Thai food. As a result, people from all over the city have been flocking to this casual downtown joint for lunch and dinner. (They also do take out orders.) My friend and I arrived at 6pm on a Thursday and the place was already almost full: tables of two and four, plus the larger tables at the front that could be utilized for larger parties or cafeteria-style seating and the bar were occupied by a mix of couples, friends and colleagues from the surrounding businesses. While we waited to be seated, I noticed a sheet of laminated paper at the host's stand imploring potential, hungry customers to be patient while waiting for a table to become available.\n\n2. Come hungry. Portions are more than reasonable and priced accordingly. We were starving and decided to try a number of dishes and split them between us: cold rolls filled with home-made chicken sausage, lettuce, carrots, mint leaves and Thai basil (Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw); crispy squash fritters (Gra Bong); a curry dish with bell and hot peppers, kaffir lime leaves and the ubiquitous Thai basil (Gaeng Panang); pad Thai; and a house specialty of stir-fried minced beef with holy basil, topped with a fried egg (Pad Gra Pra). We also ordered the only beer available, Singha. Not entirely sure why there is only one, but it's a light, refreshing beer and I had no complaints about it.\n\n3. Temper your expectations. The food at Khao San Road is good, yes,but it was not exemplary. It wasn't bad by any means, but I had very high expectations that were sadly unmet. The exception was the Pad Gra Pra which was very, very good. It's a house specialty so if you go, you might be best to stick with the items on that particular part of the menu. There was nothing wrong with the food in particular; however, after hearing such glowing reviews from both friends and reviews, I was anticipating more.\n\nAdditionally, we found the service lacking. Our order was taken promptly and our first round of drinks appeared in short order. The problems started when food began to arrive at our fairly small table faster than we could eat. I pointed this out to our server who shrugged and kept piling on the plates. Once we had all our food, our server disappeared, a problem on two fronts: we had no room to maneuver and we wanted another round of Singhas. We were able to flag her down eventually and we were served with much reluctance from that point.\n\nKhao San Road is not a bad restaurant by any stretch. The food is better than average but not spectacular. Stick with the house specialties and you'll likely do well. If you're going to go in for a sit-down meal, reservations are a must. Better yet, call ahead for take-out and have a couple of beers ready to go at home.", "stars": 2, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "date": "2012-03-30"}, {"user_id": "TacjkBCCgfe_xix2XtlvJQ", "review_id": "Hm05qceDQg2kVDTh_lyKCQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "ZkGHqd_f6hxNb5TN6Knu-g", "text": "I think since they have grown people get less back for their traded clothing than what they used to.

Second, they got the stove in,  they supposively shut off the gas as my valve is in the basement.  They claimed it could not move the stove all the way back, that i need a gas company to move the line.  This was all done on Friday.   Monday, I go in my kitchen i smelled gas.  Called the gas company to find out HHGREGG did not use the shutoff valve but loosed a bolt.  I watched them, what did i know.   Then i got Mertz to come to move gas line.  $135 later to find out they can move the stove back.   Thirdly, they put my dishwasher in crookedly.  They had to come back.  They unscrewed one side and shoved it in.  Then the disposal kept backing up in my dishwasher. I called they said that was normal.  I said no it is not.  The same guy came, moved one piece said should be good.  Heck no, called again, they made service call again.  The,people never called for time range, i called they said it is scheduled and no time. That i cannot call until after 530 if they do not show. Then called nothing, called the next day. Finally they got someone there.  He said it was hooked up wrong a suppoively fixed it.

There is one employee that has such a piss poor attitude and looks like she hates her life, but everyone else seems great. One time I placed a pick up order with a friend of yellow curry and vegetarian yellow curry. We picked our food up and went on errands. During our errands we get a call saying they gave us the wrong order and didn't include a vegetarian and we could bring it back. We said okay, we're on errands, we will. Apparently it wasn't soon enough for them because they called us back and asked where we were. When we returned they made us show BOTH the yellow curries and took one back, which I guess is fine but every other restaurant I've ever been to would let you keep the extra, and considering we drove back, I would think this is fair.

Very busy, long line. \n\nThey also have a vegan menu here (you have to ask for it, but every restaurant at the Wynn hotel has a vegan menu). My sister, the vegan, had a vegan sandwich (veggies on vegan bread) which she said was awesome.\n\nHere comes the bad news for vegans. This is a order-at-the-counter then go sit down and wait for your food to be brought to you place. The lady behind the counter who took our order was an english as a second language person. We told her repeatedly that my sister was vegan and everything she was ordering needed to be vegan. We pointed at the vegan menu several times. She still kept asking every time we ordered something, do you want that with cheese? Do you want the vegan one? YES, WE WANT THE VEGAN ONE we said, LOUDLY while pointing at the vegan menu. O.k., so at the end, we thought we had properly communicated that we needed all vegan food for my sister. On the vegan menu were vegan garlic fries, which we ordered. We made it CRYSTAL CLEAR we needed the VEGAN garlic fries, not the regular ones. Seriously, we said it SEVERAL times. Well, my sister gets her sandwich and fries and starts to eat. I say, what's that stuff on top of your fries? She said she thought it was big chunks of garlic. Then she takes a closer look and realizes it's cheese. We go to the counter and complain. The manager comes out. They replace the fries with vegan ones, but the manager seems to be blaming my sister for not ordering the right fries. Are you kidding me? We could not possibly have been any clearer. Seriously, this is a very big deal to vegans. No apology, no offer of compensation, nothing. Very disappointed in how that was handled.\n\nHere's some advice for Mr. Wynn. If you want vegans to eat at your restaurants, you need to ensure that the staff at all your restaurants understand the vegan issue, and that they speak english fluently.

But after yesterday, I have to say this place has probably been taken off our list of regular spots. \n\nWe decided to stop in on a Sunday afternoon for a bit of brunch before our 3 o'clock appointment. 2 hours should have been plenty of time, right? Apparently not. We were told the wait for a table would be about 20 minutes; 45 minutes later we were finally sat, after watching several tables remain empty on the patio the entire time we waited. Given those 45 minutes, we had plenty of time to look over the menu so we could put in our order right away. By the time we ordered our drinks and food (at the same time) it was about 2 o'clock. \n\nBy 2:30, I'd had enough. Our waitress didn't check on us the entire time we sat there. 40 minutes without a table touch... 30 MINUTES. We finally tracked her down and told her we needed our food to-go, as we had somewhere to be. She assured us she'd go check on our food and have them put it together as quickly as possible. But this seems to be relative, as 10 minutes later she returns and tells us it'll be another 5 minutes before our food could be brought out. Unfortunately at this point, we'd already decided to pay the bill preemptively because, despite everything, we were hungry. Bad move on our part, I will say. \n\nFinally, our food was brought out by (what I assumed to be) a manager, because she gave us a gift certificate for our trouble. However, this seemed to be only an afterthought when my husband brought up how long we'd had to wait for a table and for our food on top of that. I felt it should have been our waitress that tracked down a manager for that sort of thing. \n\nOn top of all of that, they put the wrong ingredients in my husband's order of the Bunny Rancheros. If the food was fantastic, I might be inclined to give them another chance. But, unfortunately, it's a bit average, and the headache is not worth it.

Very friendly guy!\n\nWe started with the the Caesar salad and the beet appetizer. Friend said it was the best salad he'd ever had. The beet appetizer was sublime. The beets were simply but flavorfully dressed and paired with goat cheese and duck prosciutto. The combination of flavors was very well balanced and the duck prosciutto had a tasty rub. Having never had duck, I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nI had the grilled chicken with bacon Mac n' cheese and subbed the kale for carrots. The meal arrived and it was a very generous portion. The two chicken breasts and accompanying poblano pepper jam were delicious. The jam was sweet and not at all spicy, and it paired very nicely with the marinated chicken breasts, which were juicy and flavorful. The mac'n cheese was creamy, comforting, and yet completely different from your typical Mac.  Plus, they did not scrimp on the bacon. Against my own better judgement, I finished every bite. The carrots and root vegetable were slightly undercooked, but the flavors were on point, and I actually didn't mind the texture. \n\nOther friends got the scallops, the 16oz  steak, the Philly cheese steak, and the bolognese. Every single one of us cleaned our plates.

For those of you who haven't tried it before, this is a great place to try it out - it tastes a lot like pop or cider but with undetectable healthy gut bacteria in every glass! \n\nThey also now have a fiasco gelato ice cream bar! It is one of the few places where you can grocery shop while digging into some passion fruit and rosemary sorbetto while you check out some of their unique products and ogle their incredible desserts and bakery goods. \n\nI love the idea of having a pint of kombucha with friends and I like that they offer the perfect environment to chat with friends with all different tastes, from the coffee or tea lover, to cider/wine/beer lover, to the kombucha lover. And their food and snack options always seem to exceed expectations in terms of flavour. \n\nTransit rating: 4 stars. Bus stop for the #1 is about a minute's walk and it runs about every 20 min to downtown to connect with the ctrains. However I've had drivers be a little inconsistent on this route (they passed the stop by accident or were early), so it's worth it to make sure you're a little early just in case.", "stars": 5, "cool": 1, "useful": 1, "date": "2016-01-17"}, {"user_id": "1Yq4Xv1W_pA7VfD6GusuxA", "review_id": "OMnCn1uF7xox6ZedpRgWmA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "IkDDjosFZ6y9rVFcO2exEQ", "text": "Elaine has cut my hair twice now, and she does an amazing job!

There are better places around but due to the convention; we expected long line ups at the other sites.\n\nHowever, this franchisee/site by the restaurant was very disappointing today on all accounts.\n\nWait staff.  Our waiter was an older south asian man that bordered on surly and quite unapologetic.  Had to walk in to ask for bread 20 min. after the food arrived.  Didn't check in on us during the first 30 min. of the meal which we had to take outside as the inside of the place was completely smoke-filled today due to defective ventilation.  Had to ask to have knives brought out.  Not deliberately rude but if I could sum it up, it would be \"service with a frown.\"  \n\nFood.  Ordered their chicken souvlaki.   Microwaved/reheated.

The Mr. Greek's closer to me home in Richmond Hill make a great take-out but most of the time, the large dining area is almost completely empty.\n\nI still heartily recommend the danforth site but their is such a large middle eastern/mediterranean community now with similar food choices; it will be hard to go back.\n\nHaving said that, I find most of the food chains by the airport to be just a half step below similar franchises elsewhere.

Other restaurants don't charge you when you ask for more wraps!  Taste wise it wasn't any better than other restaurants I tried duck.

I visited the drive thru this week and wanted to order the Reuben, which is the monthly special. That sandwich didn't appear on the touchscreen menu at the drive-thru so I pushed the button to speak to an employee. The employee told me to enter in a different kind of sandwich and they would know to make the Reuben instead. Well, when I tried to do that -- surprise -- Swiss cheese, which is supposed to come on the Reuben, wasn't listed as an option on the touchscreen because it's not standard. I had the same problem with the special Rye bread not being listed. I hit the button again but the employee didn't respond a second time. I had no idea what was going to come out of that drive-thru window now, but I was pretty sure it wasn't going to be my Reuben. After waiting 30 minutes for the three cars in front of me to get their orders I finally arrived at the window. I honestly believe that, until this very day, the employee, who was the same person I spoke to through the speaker, thought that a Reuben was that dude who beat Clay Aiken on American Idol. But she had no prior knowledge that it was also a sandwich. That was a new concept for her. So there I was at the window and my sandwich wasn't ready, as she had promised it would be. She then took my order on a paper pad like a freaking savage. I requested Swiss cheese, because, hey, it's a Reuben, but she said she didn't have Swiss and that American would have to do--yuck!! I asked for Rye and she said they didn't have Rye. Then, her manager overheard this and told her that in fact they did have Swiss and Rye, so yay me! I then asked this lady, who I assume was employee of the month, to put thousand island dressing on it, because, again, Reuben. Her eyes betrayed a bewilderment that I hadn't seen in a human since my younger brother first saw my mom working out to a Richard Simmons VHS tape in 1987. My gawd. The lady proceeded to close the window in order to, presumably, make my Reuben. I realized that I never told her to put corned beef on my Reuben (obviously, I assumed she knew I didn't want a vegetarian Reuben, but at this point I was losing confidence in this chick's sandwich knowledge faster than a knife fight in a phone booth). So I gently knocked on the window. She tentatively opened the window with a look of dread as if she thought I was the Alex Trebek of Reubens who was going to quiz her about the essential components of any sandwich that would dare wear that moniker. So, I then asked her if she was going to put corned beef on my Reuben and she said, and I quote, \"You think I'm going to serve you a Reuben without corned beef?\" To which I replied, \"Ma'am you wanted to serve me a Reuben with American cheese.\" She retorted, \"The guy in the back makes the sandwiches, he knows how to make a Reuben.\" Me: \"Mmmmmk.\" 10 more minutes passed. She then asked me to pull into a parking space because their sandwich making artist was clearly YouTubing how to make a Reuben and the store's Wi-Fi was acting up. I did as instructed and waited another 10 minutes. FINALLY, Miss Reuben emerged from the Subway Restaurant, Reuben in hand, and presented the finished sandwich to me. I thanked her for her help in facilitating the creation of my Reuben. She returned to the store. I opened the wrapper, fearful of what I might find tucked inside. Alas, soggy Rye bread and no thousand island dripped upon the watery sauerkraut. Hmm, I thought the sandwich artist knew how to make a Reuben. In fact, I was shocked that corned beef appeared on the sandwich at all, but a Reuben without thousand island is just a lunchbox sandwich whose own mother wishes that the only drug store in her small hick town wasn't owned by a crotchety Southern Baptist who refuses to stock copious amounts of Plan B. So, in total, I waited 55 minutes for a soggy, flavorless, sauceless, unloved mess of a sandwich. Total waste.

None of us have tried this place.  We were really impressed with the food.  We loved the side dishes, especially the squid. Right behind our booth, someone else was celebrating their birthday and the staff sang a  birthday song and gave him/her a complimentary dessert.  So we had to tell them it was my sister-in-law's birthday also.  Our waiter assured us she would get a dessert too.  On the corner of our booth, I was excited to see that they give a free dessert if you rate them on Yelp  at the time of the visit.  It was a limited time offer so I wanted to take advantage of that. I showed the pictures to my 4 year old nephew and as soon as he saw the colorful macaron ice cream, which he called \"ice cream burger\", he asked for it right away.  I had to coax him to finish his food first  before we  get him the free ice cream.  He agreed and waited so patiently for it.  While everyone's eating, I downloaded the Yelp app so I could rate the restaurant and get the macaron ice cream for my nephew.  I followed the instructions and gave them a really good rating based on the food itself which was a 5 star for everyone.  I got up to use the restroom and asked my husband to show the review to them (as required). However, when I returned, my sister-in-law's complimentary dessert  was already there.   They didn't sing her a song either. It, unfortunately,  wasn't what my nephew had been waiting for. Our server told us that they would only honor one.  I'm not upset about not getting the free dessert cause we could have bought him one right there instead.  For one, it was already late. I just  didn't want to see my nephew disappointed.

The prices on the menu had the tax included on them, so we knew exactly what to expect for our budget.\nMy husband even took a picture on his phone, and showed it to me when he got home.\n\nSo a few days later, I called them and kept the order simple, ordered five trays: \ntwo types of rice, two types of meat and noodles.\n\nWhen the lady on the phone told me the total, I was in awe!\n\nI did the math by the prices on their new menu, added the delivery charge, and tax, and the order was way off....by almost $70!!\n\nWhen I requested that she repeat everything back to me, she broke the charges down by what I ordered and the prices were NOT what they had posted on their menu, they were higher.\n\nI confronted her and told her that the charges she quoted me were not the prices that  they had on their menu and that my husband was in there a few days ago.\n\nShe laughed and said that is not what they have on their wall.\n\nWhen I told my husband the total he was enraged.\n\nMy husband got on the phone and asked to speak to a manager.\n\nA guy came on the phone, let my husband tell him the problem, and then said \"We give you special price\" and quoted him a different price, that was still higher than what they had posted on their wall. \n\nMy husband said \"That is not what you have posted on your wall in your restaurant, I was over there 2 days ago, all we want is the price you have advertised\".\n\nThe man said that they cannot give us that price, he didn't even explain why.\n\nThe man on the phone sounded like he didn't even care, he didn't even try to help us.\n\nSo we told them no way, and cancelled the order.\n\nThey have lost me as a customer. \n\nI am not going back there. \n\nIf they screw up like that, it makes me wonder how future orders would have been for me.\n\nI'm not asking for much.

And where exactly do these people relax after a day of walking those endless casino-miles?  Where do they get ready to go out for the night?  Where indeed do they get their freak on?\n\nThe prevailing wisdom asserts that the hotel room is the LEAST critical measure of enjoyment as pertains to the successful Vegas getaway.  I am here to disabuse you of any notion that the party-line is worth your penitent regard.  From where I sit your hotel room is by far the MOST important decision you will make when plotting your Sin-City sojourn.\n\nEasy for me to say, of course, because from where I sit is in my room at the Mandarin Oriental hotel.\n\nLocated on the periphery of City Center, right on the strip, the MOLV is your quiet and civilized oasis.  Calm.  Serene.  Tranquil.  Beautiful.  \n\nExpensive.\n\nYeah it costs more than a few extra dollars to stay here, so if you're hoarding your readies to flay the stickmen at the craps table then perhaps the IP is a better option.  But to my mind, that money is far better-spent on the tasteful luxury and warm, welcoming atmosphere afforded to the lucky traveler who rests his head here.  You will want for nothing.  You will not spend 40 minutes checking in.  You will not have to navigate a crowded and smoky casino to access your room.\n\nI admit it.  The Mandarin has spoiled me for every other hotel on the strip.  Even options I had considered \"a step up\" in the past now seem hopelessly dreary.  But on a recent visit the tariff for my room was only 20 bucks more a night than what was surely a cramped shoebox at the sprawling and cacophonous MGM Grand.\n\nAnother perk...  after inquiring of the doorman how far a walk it was to the Cosmopolitan he responded with an estimate of 5-10 minutes or so, but if i could wait 5 minutes the house car would be available to drive me to my destination.  Hmmm.... walk or be driven there in the back of a chauffeured Mercedes.  Yeah, not such a tough call, there.\n\nSo look. You can take your chances at mandalayexcaliburcircuscircuswynnmiragepalacestationpolotowersballagio or wherever else the hoi-freaking-polloi is congregating.

We knew we wanted a Vegas wedding for a while and had bookmarked Chelsea's page back in 2011. As creative professionals, we were drawn to the art and emotion in her work - strong visual storytelling, unique perspectives, and beautiful image toning. Our whole experience with Chelsea and the amazing final photos far exceeded our expectations!\n\nOur biggest concern about photography was having to book a full traditional wedding photography package when our wedding was going to be small (just parents, no reception). Chelsea offered us a nice elopement package that included two locations, up to 3 hours of coverage, and an add-on option for digital copies of all the photos. She also provided a list of recommended vendors she's worked with in the past (cakes, hair + makeup, entertainment, etc.) in case you still need to book anything. All of her informational PDFs are well designed and easy to follow. And the official billing/payment/contract stuff all happens on a secure, personalized webpage.\n\nAfter booking the session, Chelsea did a great job learning about us through email exchanges and a \"get to know you\" questionnaire. We enjoyed telling her our story, and along the way learned we had a lot in common with her. Once she knew our personalities and our wedding colors (which were CMYK), she recommended a unique, colorful location she had't shot before that would be perfect for us. So we paid a little extra to add on that 3rd location, and it was spot on for our theme.\n\nFast forward to the wedding day and our elopement photo session with Chelsea. Our three locations were The Neon Museum (for the wedding ceremony), that colorful place we referred to as CMYK Paradise, and back at our hotel (The Cosmopolitan). She got a varied mix of shots in and around each place, and truly captured our personalities and love. Our post on her blog went up exactly 6 weeks after our wedding day, and the full photo set was ready for download 3 days later. So we didn't have to wait long at all for such incredible photos.\n\nIf you're looking for artistic, romantic, unique wedding photos, Chelsea is highly recommended. She's incredibly talented, has a great personality, and makes the experience easy and fun for her clients.\n\nCheck out our photos on Chelsea's blog:\nhttp://chelseanicoleblog.com/weddings/vibrant-las-vegas-elopement-at-neon-museum", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2015-06-23"}, {"user_id": "59nHM-sdejFUvJSRQ0rhCw", "review_id": "ffPjg9Dx1z0h9y4LmnHd6Q", "funny": 0, "business_id": "0W_pPAiTXgazY2mtX6o0_w", "text": "If I lived closer to this place, I would be morbidly obese. \nThe italian beef here is the best I've ever had, and the dogs are top notch too.

I was expecting good fusion food. The experience was disappointing. Question. If Chang is from Toronto, would we even be talking about Momofuko? I do have to wonder if Chang even understands the basic concept of a bowl of noodle. Broth is hot for the noodle to absorb its flavour. Vietnamese noodle bowls fan out to let the heat escape because rice noodle softens quickly. Ramen noodle bowls don't because the noodle is thicker. Perhaps he should take a break from his experimentations and start learning the basics. (And to think that with all the experimenting, its all pretty basic traditional stuff on the menu. Hmmm....) I simple don't get the outrageously large bowl with a tiny bit noodles. I'm no food critic, foody or chef but I sure llove food. T.O. is filled with great places to eat (fusion food that really works) and I personally don't think Momofuko is up to par. Their signature noodle was way too salty. (Was that the experiment?) The noodle itself was good. Had a nice crunch. Had their octopus side. Was ok. Bland. The calamari tentacle lettuce wrap was great to look at but Very Chewy and Difficult to eat due to the large finger size tentacle pieces and the lack of utensils! Lastly, if I want kimich from a jar, would go to the market. As for the decor, the best thing is the sculpture outside. The furniture is hard, cold and uncomfortable not to mention potentially dangerous. Overall, the food and decor is good to look at with no substance. I've had more deservingly expensive noodle bowls and is more than willing to pay for it if it's Goode but this is way overpriced for the wasted time. It's definitely not the worst place to eat in TO but certainly not a place worth all the hype as it has. \n\nIs the experiment to see how much water one can dose down to counter dehydration from the salt, or see if one's heart can handle all the fat from the pork and salt from the broth at once? Hmmm. No thanks. \n\nDoes well balanced mean mixing hot and cold broth to have it Luke warm or the ability to eat your noodles in the way oversized bowls?\n\nMy 3 yr old was very creative with her overly salty, red wine vinegar based cookies but that didn't make them good.\n\nIf fast food chains can run their kitchen efficiently, I do as least expect Momofuko to, given their menu is very short and simple, kimchi from jars, and nothing served hot.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "date": "2013-08-22"}, {"user_id": "CoBS5M2oJDEa5gjYmcUqmQ", "review_id": "hj4-lAPQeDqOglGqNvLN9w", "funny": 0, "business_id": "1FnAyxRXhadIZiI1hiM65w", "text": "the food is amazing !!!!!!!! and the service is the best i love itt!", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2016-05-10"}, {"user_id": "-7UsexHfgvTGoIkjDqySGA", "review_id": "i96xx1DUods-bBRIHGCKlA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "5jBbLDUVZZWHZlVH-nPc8A", "text": "I am a formal/dress clothes aficionado and shop around a lot, and see a lot of different environments for these types of stores.

(I do not think that had anything to do with Arizona Shower Doors though). then the doors arrived, a few days later I began installation only to discover the tracks for the sliders had not been shipped with the order, I asked the manager at LOWES to hold them there so I could pick them up. (Four wasted days waiting to delivery that never showed). I picked the tracks up at LOWES. The following morning I began opening the tracks; The first thing I noticed is that where the cut the backside of the sides and the holes they drilling for the screws to mount them where jagged and rough (Unfinished) I discovered this when both of my hands became embedded with aluminum \"splinters\".  \nThe Second thing I discovered is that they did not send the screws with the door hardware. I noticed this on two of the sliders as well as the swing out door. I contacted LOWES (Again) in person to see if they could do something about this \"series of problems\". the manager was very considerate but passed me off to someone from the department where I ordered the doors who wasn't going to be in until the following day. (I should expect a call). \nThe call came and John was on the other end; I explained the situation to him aftger explaining it twice already to the LOWES management. He said he would call Arizona shower doors and  let them know.....\nI believe it was later that day or the following day that I received aa messages from John; He explained that his contact at Arizona Shower Door said to look in the boxes, that they were put in with the doors (What the F##k???).\nThats really their response, waste more of my time looking where I already looked????  come on, we are talking about screws, anchors and rubber piece for the handles that couldn't be valued at more than a few dollars. So, Rather than just get my address from John and ship the parts, they want me to waste my time (More Time) requiring me to make another call, or stop in the store AGAIN for something they should have had completed more than a MONTH EARLIER. \nCustomer Service is the new approach most companies have been focusing on in recent years and realizing a significant ROI in doing so. \nI think its time to just ask LOWES to come get the doors and refund the money or reorder through another supplier. \nI realize people have \"bad days\" but someone at Arizona Shower Doors was having several consecutive \"bad days\" which they were kind enough to share with me,...the customer. I've already lost three days or roughly $1,500.00.  And I am the person who brought one of my homeowners to them for this order of more than 2k. (Total order that day at LOWES was $3,350.00).\n\nI still have no idea what the quality of the doors are. I do know the tracks are as bad as anything I have ever received all the years I've been remodeling or flipping homes covering four states. My hands became infected from the slivers of aluminum from the door tracks making it difficult to do certain things.\n\nI would drop them as a vendor if I was making those decisions at LOWES. at least for a few months ( A Time out ;=))\n\nUpdate; 12/2/14; Returned everything to LOWES. After several attempts to get the missing parts, I have no more time for this. Arizona Shower Doors & this LOWES location will never receive business from my clients again.

I felt bad for disappointing him, but after spending $50 for a single meal, I have a right to be a tad critical.  So here's how it stacks up:\n\nPROS\n\n-Amazing food.  The ingredients seemed fresh and well assembled, and every dish I tried was incredibly flavorful....  Gourmet indeed!  (And the only reason this buffet gets three stars from me instead of one or two.)\n-Varied selection of dishes/cultural representations\n-Gorgeous atmosphere.  I loved the clean lines of polished glass and stainless steel at every turn.  And I appreciate the fact that each separate area has its own individual look and feel.\n-STREET TACO STATION!

However, by the time I was able to make it out of the crazy line for food, they were ice cold and the carnitas were hard.    More on that below...\n\nCONS\n\n-Price.  This mutha is EXPENSIVE.  I mean, seriously, what is that about?  I chose to try this the one time for the experience, but for what this buffet offers, it hardly seems worth it.  I could go to the Wynn buffet or, to a lesser degree, Wicked Spoon to get more for my money (if the goal was, as it usually is, stuffing my face with yummy foods!).  \n-Service lagged.  Once my friend was able to flag down one of the servers to order our drinks, he was pretty good about seeing to our needs.  Initially, though, he was nowhere to be found.  We had just come from the Valley of Fire about 40 minutes outside of Vegas and were dying of thirst, but no one came to ask for our order for a good 10-15 minutes after being seated.  Plenty of servers passed us and our conspicuously empty table that evening, but no one bothered to stop.\n-LINES!  CRAZY, UNFORGIVING, TORTUROUSLY LONG LINES!!!  As a few previous reviewers have noted, this place has an absolutely awful set up.  I can see that if they just moved a few of the stations around the dining area (perhaps on the other side of the dessert bar, for instance), it would help immensely with the pileup of angry/hungry patrons.  As it was, I waited a good hour on my feet, plate in hand, just for a chance to SEE what foods were offered!  And this is after waiting almost an hour and a half just to get in!!  The line hardly ever moved because the lady working the carving station moved at a glacial pace and honestly looked like she could cry from being overwhelmed with orders.  I would've avoided the meat altogether, really, but after waiting that long to get a shot at my different options, I knew I had to at least try some ribs and the brisket.  There would be NO going back, that's for sure!!  I hardly ever got a chance to eat with my friends because we all stood in the massive line of doom at varying times.  :(  Boo...\n-Rude staff.  The situation in line was intense, folks, as I have mentioned, but there was intensity from the kitchen, too.  When I had finally made my way up to the carving station (hallelujah!), an older gentleman came right up in front of me and lifted his plate up, asking if the carving lady could put just the tiniest piece of chicken on it.  While I was in NO MOOD to allow someone to cut in front of me, even I felt this sweet old man deserved a better response than what he received...  One of the kitchen staff heard him and came forward, rudely yelling at him to get to the back of the line.  He scowled in the general direction of the rest of us, too.  I get that he may have been having a rough night with a bunch of unhappy patrons, but there was no need for that.  I'm a big girl, and I can speak for myself, thanks.\n-Repeatedly out of foods.  I missed out on mac and cheese and green tea mochi balls, people!  And once they ran out, there was no replacing them.\n-THEY LIMIT YOUR PORTIONS.  ...Think about this.  It's a buffet, for crying out loud!  For $50, I think I am entitled to pile my plate if I choose, but management came around and literally limited the quantity of meats per person.  Not cool.  Not cool at all!", "stars": 3, "cool": 1, "useful": 10, "date": "2013-01-23"}, {"user_id": "zhzsK_GyXxDu9bGYAMx26A", "review_id": "67qKmFbEFcfHQqGergCuPA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "biytZvOpixyEQZEtZnwWcQ", "text": "I was feeling suicidal and extremely sad in the summer when I called the distress centre for the first time.

The guy with long hair up front was cool. \n\n/the dancers. I'm not a dancer, but I can tell when people are trying. This cast was uncoordinated with each other. There was a lot of individual talent (tall blonde, Hispanic guy that opened show, Asian guy) but as a whole, a lot was lacking. Maybe there was some talent from the other 3-4 dancers, but i didn't see it. It's an hour long show. Wish I would've got some effort for my money. \n\n/charismatic band was awesome. Saved a lot of moments. Drummer solos were awesome!!!\n\n//good show overall. But with so many dancers clutters on stage, you'd expect it to be a priority of the show. But they're kind of just there.
