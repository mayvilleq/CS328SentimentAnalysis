Upon arrival we found that this is an odd spot on Queen West where a string of three of four Indian restaurants are all lined up side-by-side, so which to choose?\n\nOne thing I love about Toronto restaurants that you won't always find in smaller cities are menus posted on the outside of the building.  Little India stood out for it's well-organized, easy to understand and well-priced menu - in we went.\n\nIt is definitely an intimate spot, having no real capacity to hold very large groups, but was still quite comfortable for our dining duo. It was a cold Thursday night and not overly busy, so it did not feel crowded, and it gave the servers that much more time to be attentive.\n\nThe menu is substantial and has a variety of dishes. The price range is about $15 - $20 for an entr\u00e9e, but be sure to ask which ones come with rice or Naan and which don't so that you can order them on the side.  First up was the mixed platter appetizer, which included samosas, onion bhajia, pakora and spring rolls. Everything was crispy, hot and just the right size for something before the entr\u00e9e-and it came in at under $5.\n\nFor the main, I ordered the chicken kebab and my dinner partner had the Madras chicken.  Fair warning: if they tell you it's going to be hot, then it's truly hot.  We are all too accustomed to those Canadian-ized restaurants that tone down their spiciness to appease the masses, and it is arguable that Little India may do this too, but in any case, take the servers' recommendations to heart.  I do enjoy some heat, but my taste buds can't handle extremes, so I steered clear on this occasion-except for a little taste of the Madras.  For those of you who do like spice, you'll love this!  It has that heat that creeps up after a few bites, not that punch-in-the-face-burn that you might get from cheap chicken wings covered in Frank's Red Hot. Our server did lean my friend toward the less-spicy of the dishes she was deciding between at first, much to her dismay, but as it turns out his suggestion right on.  As for my tamer dish, it had more of a Mediterranean flavour to it; grilled, lemony and came with a cucumber salad garnished with cilantro.  It was a happy reminder of summer while dining in the depths of winter.\n\nOne of the greatest things about this restaurant is something I was not even able to take advantage of: the lunch buffet.  This is a bit of a hike from my own home and workplace, but for those of you in the area, I say go for it!  Buffets have a bit of a bad reputation (and for the most part it's well-deserved), but a small arrangement at a non-chain location like this can be a perfect opportunity to try a variety of what is on the menu, especially if it is food you're mostly unfamiliar with.\n\nOverall, I can't leave you saying it was the very best Indian cuisine I've ever had, but I can say that I wasn't disappointed, and I would go back again-especially for that buffet.", "date": "2011-01-22", "cool": 2, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "business_id": "P6JCepLy6zlq-jEsrAqkKA", "stars": 3}, {"useful": 2, "funny": 3, "review_id": "jk9POXdfBbBfLTjgO8YFFg", "text": "I guess I'm not excited about this place because for me, it not only has limited options, it doesn't actually have a good option.

I guess they should. They tout themselves as being Toronto's first onsite roastery--since 1988. Despite all that time, it's not a colossal roasting operation. In fact, it's a small machine in the front window of the shop, but that's part of the appeal of this place: fair-trade coffee roasted onsite, in small batches, right in front of your eyes.\n\nAs it becomes available, Coffee Tree scrawls all of their different roasts and blends of contrasting kinds of beans on a chalkboard near the front entrance. Some of these blends and roasts change from time-to-time; others are Coffee Tree's signatures. On any given day, you can expect to find Casa Primi, Sensuous Morning, Tuscany, and Millionaire's Mixture; some of their well-known signatures. Other days, you can find blends that have been created exclusively for the week or month.\n\nRegardless of what you choose, this coffee is superb, roasted perfectly, and balanced. Sip it slowly, and you'll definitely find complexity. There's the perfect blend of sweet and savoury and none of the unpleasant bitterness you'd expect from other coffee shop brews.\n\nBut it ain't all coffee at Coffee Tree. They've got a surprisingly detailed food menu, considering it's a coffee joint. From breakfast, lunch, and dinner, to French toast, sandwiches, and empanadas, they've got something for whatever time of day you go. They've also got a chilled dessert fridge featuring in-house made desserts, which includes what they call--and I'm inclined to agree--the World's Best Carrot cake. If you're there, give it an unregrettable try.\n\nThe shop layout is the typical long narrow space of most Toronto street-level businesses, and unfortunately, their furniture and decorating ideas aren't much of a help. Despite having unforgettable coffee, the space makes the experience of drinking it feel closed off.  They do, however, support local art by featuring a local artist's work on their walls for sale, and that certainly is a plus, but when I was there, the art wasn't something I was particularly captivated by; but I'm told it changes. All this place really needs a little reno, and it would be near perfect, or at least get 5 stars in my review.\n\nDespite the poor decor choice, they still roast some brilliant coffee.

So, we left abs paid our bills but they hassled us to leave even more so no one got change. We all over-tipped by $3-$6 dollars. Once our small group was out we had a waitress chase after us, specifically, my boyfriend saying he never paid in full. Bullshit, considering he fucking over-tipped too because I saw him put over the amount and complained about it. Being a nice guy he paid the waitress more then the difference on the fucking street. Too bad I was walking ahead of our group at the time and only saw the latter part of the transaction. Or else, that waitress would have a bleeding ear from my yammering. \n\nWorst service I've ever had in my life.

Looked like a cool spot to hang out and wait for your movie if you were early, or even to it and chat, if on a date, after the movie.\n\nYou can purchase your tickets at the automated machines, or buy/pick them up inside at Guest Services.  \n\nThe employees were very cordial as we passed them on our way to our seats inside the theater.  We decided on the Cinema Suites, since it was 21&over.  We were impressed with the layout, and the very comfortable seats that recline.  Our server was very nice and informative.  I was surprised when she was entering our order into her pad, the other servers were bring our drinks and appetizers.  WOW!  That's faster and more impressive than a restaurant.  \n\nI had the sirloin tips and mashed potato's, and my wife had the fried shrimp with fries.  I can't comment on any mixed drinks, (another reviewer complained of watered down drinks) mainly because we had wine. \n\nAll in all, it was ok.  Kinda like food at an Applebee's, or Chili's.  Nothing to go crazy about, mediocre, and over priced, but it WAS a MOVIE THEATER.  I mean, It's not a Michelin Star restaurant.  I don't care that it is in the Biltmore area.\n\nThe thing that annoyed us the most were the 2 pompous couple's we sat between.  They constantly complained about something.  Mostly their refills.  The waitress explains to you, should you need something, PUSH the call button.  They never did.  They expected someone to come by.  The point of the call button is to minimize the wait staff running around disturbing patrons who are watching the movie.  \n\nThis is the main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. They were really annoying. \n\nIt's like this.......You are at a THEATER that serves food and drinks.  Not at a Fancy restaurant that shows a movie.  You're paying for the comfort and experience of being able to relax, enjoy a drink or dinner, all while watching a movie.\n\nBottom line, Food was ok, a little over priced, so watch what or how much, you order.  If you like to drink, have a beer, wine, or straight drink, if you are so worried of getting it watered down.  The employees from beginning to end were excellent.

Really gross.\n\nAfter a few minute wait, a male employee told us he was ready for us.  I would guess his name is Joshua based on the name on my receipt.

He looked very unkept with a shaggy beard and chipping painted black nails. But that's not even my biggest complaint. Although I think it's important to have a kept up appearance if you work at a salon ...I really don't care if you do your job right. Unfortunately, this was not the case as his appearance matched his skill. He was a  very poor stylist with obviously little education/knowledge.  He did not know how to even do a basic kids haircut.  We wanted a simple fade.  No joke, it took Joshua 30 minutes to try to do a simple fade on a seven-year-old.  A kind woman he was working with had to come over and help him multiple times. He kept looking back at her for help to because he obviously didn't know what he was doing.  All the while, my son was sitting so patiently, wondering when he was going to be done.  Very disappointed. If the stylist does not know how to do a boy child haircut he should not have taken my son on. \n \nI was even more disappointed upon arriving home and seeing that he didn't at all cut the top. It was completely uneven. I literally had to just buzz it myself when we got home.  Talk about a waste of time and money!

You would be wrong, however, to make that assertion.  In my mind, even the least-interesting Picasso still veritably hums with the genius that has conferred upon him the status as a near-consensus choice as the single most important artist of the modern era.\n\nAnd just as one must, in the course of appreciating the art, ignore the piggish chauvinism that the artist himself exhibited during his reign... one must likewise ignore the missteps that mar the canvas of Chef Julian Serrano's menu if one is to be receptive to the more vivid charms that are in evidence.\n\nThe space itself is quite lovely.  Rich and sumptuous, with dim lighting that is punctuated by spotlights shining down on both the tables and the million-dollar canvasses that line 3 of the surrounding walls.  The fourth wall opens up onto the aforementioned \"lake\" and its ever-present circus of projectile choreography.  As cheap a thrill as it is, I must confess an abiding fondness for this brand of contemporary Vegas kitsch.  You would do well to note that the fountains are freakin' LOUD, though... and if you are the skittish type you might ask for a table a little farther away from the sideshow.\n\nOur meal commenced with an amuse of boiled quail egg and smoked salmon on a skewer served with a small cup of leek and potato soup garnished with slivered almonds.  The skewer was rich and silky, with the appropriate notes of salt and smoke, and the soup was earthy and luscious, the almonds providing good textural contrast.\n\nMy first course was a bowl of butternut squash soup, (a holdover from the fall/winter menu perhaps?)  Regardless, it was cloying and unremarkable.  It was helped, slightly, by the addition of some tasty bread and butter but on the whole it left me with that arched-eyebrow \"Oh Lord, here-we-go\" look of disappointment that I sometimes get.  Yes, sometimes.  REALLY, it's only SOMETIMES!!  Stop hitting me in the shoulder, dammit!\n\nSecond course found me sizing up a dish of langoustine tails with asparagus in a saffron broth.  Sounds delicious, right?  Well in this case everything clicked and I'm happy to report that delicious is exactly what it was.  A brilliant little piece of chamber music on a plate.  A richly satisfying meditation of harmony and balance and if I weren't such a neurotic snob I would have licked my plate clean.  In my shame I must confess that the best I could do was to sop up the remaining broth with more of that tasty bread.\n\nFor the main course I selected the veal chop and for the most part was happy I did.  The chop itself was delicate and toothsome.  My only complaint is that the pan jus upon which it rested was lifeless and ordinary.  Pan jus is one of those things that, when done properly, can elevate a simple dish toward unexpected heights.  Such an elixir should be part of every great chef's arsenal but on the night in question it's addition did little more than color the plate.  Pity.\n\nMy friends and I decided to supplement our menu with a plate of the night's special meat, an offering of Kobe beef, which we felt necessary to compliment the fine bordeaux and Rioja we had assembled.  When it was presented to the table, however, it was distressingly overdone.  Not even borderline, mind you, but just short of grey-all-the-way-through.  How it even made it out of the kitchen is a puzzle I am sure I will never decode.  To their faint credit, the offending dish was whisked away and replaced with a suitably-cooked replacement.  That said, the beef was only great, falling well short of the magnificence that it should have shown.  What a disappointing, yet somehow fitting metaphor for the overall experience.\n\nOne aspect I feel compelled to note is the incredibly gracious treatment shown to us by the Head Sommelier, Robert.  We brought our own wines and he really went the extra mile in creating a superb experience.  If only the restaurant as a whole had manifest such careful attentions I imagine I would have expected nothing less than the Young Ladies of Avignon to grace the walls.  As it was, the wine service was enough to catapult Picasso in my esteem to 4-star status.  And if you hit it really big at the tables, ask Robert to open one of the 1947 Cheval Blancs he has in the cellar.

Some of the best I've had in 4 continents, and truly, they are what they're made out to be-TASTY!\n+Really chill music playlist that helped add to the ambiance and environment\n+Nice decorations downstairs, with oriental rugs and paintings.\n+Chalk hand-written menu on an ordering wall is always fun.\n\nCons:\n\n-It can get quite loud inside, in the downstairs area even with minimal customers (due to poor acoustics?).\n\n-Free water dispensers aren't filled with ice and aren't very chilled\n\n-The Tahini sauce is not particularly flavorful, but the chili sauce you can serve yourself definitely helps bring out its flavor if you mix the two!\n\nOVERALL:\n\nYou can't go wrong going here...I hesitate to recommend it completely just so it doesn't get too busy and inaccessible (for me), but really, it's pretty great and the negatives are really minor things that may not bug you, so give it a try!", "date": "2013-10-05", "cool": 1, "user_id": "wjxbu8UBQmr-CGSgOPYGIQ", "business_id": "t67GMPZ0cv_ItKlID-JFiQ", "stars": 4}, {"useful": 3, "funny": 0, "review_id": "9hamkP-WOUAknvT-eWSZeg", "text": "I went here for a physical!
