Kent is just one of a series of 'Duke Pubs' scattered around Toronto, and judging from the fairly comprehensive website, each has a slightly different d\u00e9cor, but all of them seem to tap into that English corner pub ambience.\n\nAfter a long week at work, I was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint, enjoy some hearty food, and catch up with some friends; the Duke of Kent was a great choice...for the most part.\n\nI snagged a corner booth with my dinner group on a busy Friday night.  When we first walked in, it seemed hopeless. We wanted dinner, but there was nary a table to be seen.  The staff did everything they could to make a space for us so we weren't forced back out into the cold to one of the other countless restaurants in the area.  That is what service is all about, and we were happy to stay.  Many thanks to the serving staff for being so accommodating on a hopping Friday night!\n\nAs for the food, it is the expected and welcomed pub spread.  They offer up fish & chips (yes, served in a basket on paper), pot roast and potatoes with buttered peas, and even bangers and mash.  You will find an array of reasonably priced English pub food on the menu, with entrees coming in at about $12 across the board.\n\nAs I've said before, I tend to go for the specials, and that night it was Moroccan Stew.  Unfortunately, I am sad to say it was disappointing.  The dish was somewhere between a curry and a Mexican chili, and I was given a healthy serving for the $12.99 price-point.  But, I couldn't help but become envious of those around me who had gravy-topped pot pies, crispy fish and chips, beefy burgers and gooey quesadillas.  I probably would not have been as put-off by the it if it was labelled on the menu, as it was on my bill - just 'vegetable stew'.  It was not as exotic as the name lead me to believe, and with a delicious-looking curry dish on the main menu, I expected more spice and life in my 'Moroccan' Stew special.\n\nFor a visit to the Duke, I suggest going full-English.  I saw enough plates of fish and chips go by to convince me that it is a popular item, and how much more traditional can you get than that?  Also, I have the 'famous' deep-fried pepperoni targeted - it has to be famous for a reason!\n\nAt the end of it all, the Duke of Kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd, and provides a great atmosphere and service, albeit a bit slow - but hey, it was busy!

The pretzel bread is quickly turning into a favorite for all of us.  \n\nI've been to brew pubs all over the country and one thing that NMB needs to do is have 3-4 of their best beers on tap at all time.

On one trip to NMB I went right after work, which at most places is when it starts to get busy.  The bartender did check on all of us before taking off for 5 minutes for a smoke.  In those 5 minutes a few other people showed up to the bar and had to wait until the bartender came back.  If it's close to 6 PM your bar should be staffed.

I wanted a 2013+ hatchback that was more economical than flashy and around 10,000 and wasn't silver (I know the second part is little ridiculous, but really didn't want a silver car). The other dealerships were quoting me above 10,000 for 2013 hatchbacks with 70,000+ miles on them. Things were looking bleak but after my dad went here he said they had exactly what I was looking for! He said I would most likely like the Nissan or the Chevys they had on the lot both were non-silver 2016 hatchbacks that were right around 35,000 miles at 9,000. My jaw dropped because both cars were in great shape and they had so many options! When I arrived we were greeted right away! All the salesmen were professional, knowledable and treated me with the utmost respect. My dad and I had a plan for me to finance through my bank but we didn't realize they didn't accept cash or credit card so we fumbled around like a couple of amateurs but ultimately decided to have Hertz finance it. We ended up staying late because there was an accident that happened on the lot but the salesmen despite them probably wanting to go home showed no signs of rushing or trying to cut corners. They gave us great service from start to finish! I ended up purchasing my Nissan there with the extended insurance.

I waited 30-45 minutes before i just walked out. not only was it an inconveniemce for me to have to return for repair but i I paid $60 for my original service and I didn't notice the nail tech messed up my big and 3rd toe until I got home. I politely walked out and said \"I'll come back\" but decided the character of the owners spoke for itself. A customer is a customer and my time is as valuable as anyone else's. I will not be returning!!! This place has nice staff but they need a course in professionalism. There are millions of nails places in the area there is one in south end and also easy blvd that I like plus there are 2 polished nail bars both less than 10 minutes from here.... I don't have to be treated like a 2nd class citizen.", "date": "2013-07-21", "cool": 1, "user_id": "8fpIYnamGlh_gzcFQ5VVCQ", "business_id": "2N6geaTHR3g7RW-V23FNOQ", "stars": 1}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "1FFNyt3QiVK7leZU5GDh2g", "text": "Perhaps the finest dining experience in the South West. Simple, refined, highest quality and taste, the Greek salad, octopus, seafood and lamb chops. Huge selection of wines. Did I mention fresh seafood is flown in daily?!.

(Although she didn't know what savory meant?)\nSometimes when the point of sale is a cashier it can seem like you're on your own once you get your food. But they grabbed hot sauce for me and cleared the table, all while checkin in and striking up conversation.
