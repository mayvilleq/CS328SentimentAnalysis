I urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as I got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn't clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt \"oops\" then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut. Next I told her I wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as I'm watching her file my nails I have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval. After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say \"that's not almond\" uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says \"hurry up\" now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies \"oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though\" can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right.

However, I haven't gotten a chance to try it until this time at 2011.  \n\nI struggle over 30 min on what rating I should grade the Buffet at Wynn Hotel,  I don't know I should put 3 or 4 starts, for sure not 5 stars perfect rating.  Then, I settle with 3-star.  I'd like clarify, it is a 3-star within all the 5-stars hotels competition around in Las Vegas.   If you take about \"general\" rating, it may be 4-star, mainly due to atmosphere and service.    3-star is FOOD only, if good food and variety is what you are looking for.  Not to mention, I have to pay $46 per person to go in.  \n\nWhy 3-stars?  I think it failed in 5 main dishes.  1.)  The prime rib and honey-baked ham is too dry.   It almost has no juice in the meat.   2.) Seafood selection is poor, and the sea bass was over cooked.  It was too dry too.   Oyster was so small, and the spinach on top was only at room temperature.  other seafood selection is kind of limited.  I only see King-crab, sea bass, smoked salmon, and oyster.  3.) Asian and Japanese food is SUPER limited too, and doesn't taste very good.   4.) Italian food, so-so.    5.) the juice are not 100% flesh, they are from concentrated formula mixed with a flesh juice.  \n\nGood thing the \"Black pepper backed ham\"  save the day, it was cooked carefully, and the meat was carefully selected.  It has a well balance of meat and a little fat to make it juice and smooth.     King crab is not bad.  They pre-cut them in half, making it a lot easier for us to eat.  Good job.  \n\nOne thing may worth mention about the choice of drinks.   You have a choice of buffet or buffet with Champagne.   What we didn't know, and our waiter didn't inform us, is that there are actually 3 different type of alcoholic blended drinks are offered with the standard buffet.  So, you have choices not only to soda, juice and coffee (Tea), you have at least 3 other choices (more expensive)... I forgot the name.  I will try to get them next time.\n\nI feel very fortunate that I have tried a lot other 5-stars type of buffet around the world.  before, like Hyatt, Shangri-la, Four Season, Hillton,  Mandalay Bay at LV, Bellagio at LV, Mirage (back in the early 90s) ... etc    So, after having many of experience I had, I think a 3-star for food taste and choice is fair..    \n\nI tried a 2 times in the week.  one for Breakfast / bunch.  One for dinner.  \n\nOn the side note, comparing to Wicked Spoon which I tried a few months ago.  I think Wicked Spoon offers more choices on the desert and and salad section..\n\nGood luck on your choice and enjoy your meals.  :-)", "cool": 0, "date": "2011-11-27", "funny": 0, "review_id": "4KlQTIPn4gLkaCWwk2ZURA", "business_id": "2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ", "stars": 3, "user_id": "nza_57QyRMqfVl3zjmTp_g", "useful": 0}, {"text": "Not the place to go for a nice dinner.

I decided to write this review because the last appointment I had reminded me why I love this office.\n\nOffice? Beautiful. Staff? Friendly. \n\nThe dentists are thorough and the hygienist is probably the nicest hygienist you will ever meet. The Doctors are great. You can always depend on them to be honest with you. Options are always given. Sometimes appointments start a little late but when they do take you in you are out just as quickly. I have only met the lady doctor once before and it was pleasant but Dr.Michael is usually the one I see when I get a check up and he is quick and efficient.\n\nThe hygienist is very honest, patient and thorough. She wants to know how she can make your experience better throughout the appointment. She always welcomes you with a smile and leaves you with the receptionist with a smile. The experience is completely different from dental offices 15-20 years ago. My whole family, including my kids, love her. You can see the difference when you sit with Karen because she cares. My first appointment with the office several years ago started with her. I used to hate dental offices and Karen completely reassured that dental offices are not something to fear. She actually said to my son \"Am I scary?\" which she is not, she knew how to diffuse a \"scary\" moment. She is gentle when cleaning and thorough. \n\nOverall atmosphere is great.

Three days after my first visit I went back in because the medication wasn't working.. When I was asked what was wrong I would begin to explain and would be interrupted every time. I was not given the chance to finish. The doctor gave me stronger meds and sent me on my way. After I went for my MRI I went back into get my results. The doctor explained to me that in the MRI there was nothing really serious and that I should be alright. When I was asked if I was ready to go back to work I informed the doctor that I was still feeling pain. This is when I felt the Jekyll and Hyde situation happened. He went from happy to pissed and 1.5 seconds. He began to yell at me telling me I didn't want to go back to work and he refused to fill out any FMLA papers that I needed to hand into work. He filled out a form for me to get blood work done and told me that my job was in jeopardy and walked out of the room. Oh I should add he also got in my face while talking with a loud voice. I really didn't want to go back there but I was unsure if another doctor would release me for work if they didn't treat me. I went back to get my blood results and to see if he was willing to release me for work. My blood work came back and it showed that I had inflammation I don't know about you but I pretty much think that indicates I'm in pain. The doctor did a 360 and was once again kind. This time he did fill out my FMLA papers and I left there with the intentions of never going back.

Additional charges may apply for some requests. For accommodation preferences for the physically challenged, please call us at 1-800-CAESARS.\"\n\nI had no choice but to except that - BUT I don't understand, if I'm booking a specific room I should get what I paid for.\nThen, I asked for the crib (which was obviously not ready in our room) and I was told I need to pay for it.\n***On the phone call that I made earlier no one told me about the rooms not being available nor that I have to pay for the crib!***\n\nI told the guy at the front desk, that if I am not getting the king size beds I should not pay for the crib. Eventually he said that he will not charge me for it.\n\nIn addition, he suggested that we will switch to a king size room the day after (Saturday), and to expect a voice mail from the registration desk.\nNo need to mention that no one called us or contact us in any way and we never got the king size beds.\nThe first night was quiet and calm.\nThe second night, 3am a cloud of cigarette smoke took over our room.\nA group of young people were partying in the next room. Doors were slamming, people were shouting and cursing all over.\nAnd then - my 17 months old baby woke up coughing! The smoke was so dense as if someone was standing next to our beds and smoking in our faces!\nTo remind you, we asked for a NON-SMOKING room, which I assume will be placed on a non-smoking floor, or am I wrong?\nIt is unacceptable to me that my baby will wake up coughing in the middle of the night because the room is full of smoke - after I paid for a non-smoking environment. \nIn addition, my parents were in the next room - experiencing that exact smoke experience. My mother just recovered from cancer, and this is a health hazard for her.\nI would recommend to change the air filters because when comparing this hotel to others (Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Cesar's Palace, Wynn, New York New York, and many more) - this is the hotel with the worst cigarette smell in the lobby. \nThe only good experiences we had are the pool and the \"House Hash a Go Go\" restaurant.\nWe are extremely disappointed from this experience, and will make sure to share it with our family, friends, and colleagues.\n\n\nHere is their response:\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to write and for making us aware of your experience at Rio Las Vegas.

I was a little skeptical at first because of the recently reviews but I was pleasantly surprised overall. \n\nPros:\n- On the strip! Love that we didn't have to use a taxi once and even in that crazy 104 degree heat. It was so close to all the nightlife and shopping, couldn't have been in a better location.\n- Price: It averaged about $135 a night (before taxes and fees) but we booked our rooms over 6 months in advance though. After taxes and fees it was actually $164 a night. so not bad but not great either\n- Staff: The staff was mostly friendly and accommodating when they could be. Our bell hop who took everything from our rooms down to valet was wonderful. He smiled the entire time he loaded 4 ladies worth of luggage onto his cart and even had our car pulled around for us and loaded by the time we finished with checkout. The cleaning staff was also very friendly, they happily brought us extra towels and changed our bedding while we were away. Since my friend and I were there for EDC, we made a bit of a mess every day getting ready in the bathroom and even though we told them they didn't have to worry about it, they still tidy up after us. I left the cleaning staff a large tip for our 4 day stay seeing as how they were probably going to be trying to get glitter out of the carpet for a week... \nIn room checkout: Can you say awesome??? Didn't have to fight with the lines with new guests arriving for early check ins. Loved that we could take our time getting packed up that morning to leave.\n- Casino: It was very nice and well maintained, all the machines seemed to be in working order and I even won $120 bucks! Right on!\n- Food: They have several restaurants in the hotel but we choose Hash a Go Go, their potions were MASSIVE and very well priced. My mother and I shared a waffle breakfast plate and we still couldn't finish it all between the two of us. I highly recommend Hash a Go Go, everything there is made fresh and from scratch and you can taste the difference.\nLocation: Seriously an amazing location, they were located in practically the heart of the strip, every direction had something you could see or do. Harrah's also has a Quad located just outside the hotel, it had many shops here and there and multiple food options to choose from. We never had to eat at the same place twice all four days we were there.\n- Extra: There is a full Starbucks just outside the elevators that take you up to the pool and your room. Very nice I didn't have to walk everywhere to find some decent coffee in the mornings.\n\nCons:\n- The 'internet' charge: I wish Harrahs would just suck it up and jump into the 21st century already. They didn't have wireless internet! Not a huge deal but when they told me I'd still have to pay for the in room wired internet even though I didn't bring ANY device that would be able to connect to it, therefore I wouldn't use it once, I was a little upset. We fought at check in to get that ridiculous resort fee removed but with no luck, seriously ridiculous though making a guest pay for something they weren't going to be using.\n- Small pool: I was glad to see they had a pool although it was a small area. For the amount of guests able to stay in the hotel, the pool was totally under sized. It was nice to see they had a bar and a small shop down in the pool area where you could purchase pool noodles, water guns, sun screen, snacks, ect.  They had lots of towels handy but no one seemed to be changing the towels on the chairs after guests left.  We had to removed the wet towels ourselves and find extra to cover because the chairs were damp. Also, they was VERY limited area to sit of lay out and get some sun. There was only 2 small sections of seating where you didn't have to be a VIP member or reserve a table with bottle service in order to even sit in the space. \nConfused guests: Now, I don't believe this is the direct fault of the staff but on Sunday, we had what seemed as some very confused new guests wondering our halls. They began trying their keys in random rooms and started banging (not knocking, they were hitting the doors with their fists) on different doors looking for who I could only assume was the others they were suppose to stay with. When they came to our door and tried their keys, we called from the other side that they had the wrong room. That's when this older lady started banging on the door and shouting at me in a different langue, boy was she surprised to see me (in full EDC make up, fake lashes, glitter and all) swing that door open and ask how I could help her. She just gawked at me and then quickly continued on her way down the hall until we called the staff to come and help them.\n\nOverall, I think I'd stay here again c:", "cool": 2, "date": "2014-06-25", "funny": 2, "review_id": "V2PbZZDn0tGbq0urtmlesg", "business_id": "NY80DkkCfEl198JmwtO4pA", "stars": 4, "user_id": "R7rLR0sZ9kYWUCva_unSMQ", "useful": 3}, {"text": "Good food.

We got stuck behind hundreds of people funneling into a corridor that carried people both to Canadian customs and connecting flights. We stood in that crowd until some figured out that 90% of the people were waiting to enter Canada and people with US connections could fight their way through to a line with no one in it. UNTIL that came to a screeching halt down stairs where they were filtering people through customs and security to get US connections. The we waited in a line of 50-70 people with one - count it - one security lane open. A good 30 of those people - including us had a half hour or less to make connecting flights. Evidently some of the airlines held flights to let passengers pass security.

So, funny thing is we were on our way to Texas Road house, which is right next door, we turned in the wrong parking lot and decided to give it a try cause we had never been to a Lone Star Steakhouse before, but frequented the Road house back in the Midwest.It seemed their prices were a bit higher, but for a good steak well worth it . I ordered a 8oz sirloin with a baked potato and salad, around $14. I also got a margarita. The waitress was prompt, but seemed maybe fairly new cause she didn't know much about the menu. She forgot our waters and came back with half a loaf of bread and forgot again. The bread was not very good and butter was unspreadable. The bread was cold so it just kind of tore apart. One slice each and we were at the end of it. Our salads came and before I could ask for more bread she was gone. My salad was way over dressed. And because it was a vinaigrette I kept coughing at the abundance. I had to chug my magarita cause no waters yet. They called it a chopped salad and I see why. Like litterly every piece of cucumber was a shaving of skin. Its like they peeled the cucumber into my salad. I even had a  lettuce end in my bowl! I wish I would have picked two sides instead of the salad now. margaritas were ok, not to strong but lacking something. I like that they brought out the glass and shaker so you get a little more in your glass. So it was more like one and a half margaritas. But for $9. So on to the meal. Both steaks we asked cooked medium. They were well done with only a little tiny pink in the center. Not a single drop of  juice on my plate or in my mouth. Dry and tough. I don't usually like to complain at a restaurant unless I really need to. I thought about it, but they would probably offer to recook it and we had plans after. Also I know it's hard to eye a steak with out weighing it, but my husband got the 6oz and I got the 8oz, but his looked bigger than mine.   My husband added on shrimp to his. It came with 8 shrimp on two screws on a bit of rice. He shared with me and the rice was good and so were the shrimp. They were cold though, but they do cool fast. I was just so disappointed that a steak house doesn't know how  cook a steak and their so called seasoning sucked. I could tell the waitress knew we were unhappy cause she avoided us like the plague. I think she over heard us talking about how tough they were. She only came back once to quickly grab our plates and said let me take these for you. Never asked how anything was and returned with the bill just setting it and leaving. She was not a good server.

Currently, she has started her job in NC and I'm still out in Phoenix. Our dishwasher in the new house is broken and my wife put in a repair request on 2/4. On 2/10 a representative from Sears came out and looked over the dishwasher and ordered the replacement part. That part is currently sitting at our house. So far, we've paid a $75 service fee to the Sears repair technician they sent out.\n\nThe repair technician set an appointment yesterday for 1-5pm with my wife. My wife took off work to be there during that time frame. At 3pm the tech called my wife saying he was behind schedule and would be there around 5pm. At 5pm he called and said he'd be there at 6pm. At 6pm he didn't show up and my wife called him and he said it would be after 7. The tech then called at 7 and wanted to reschedule the appointment(two hours after the allotted appointment time frame was over) but my wife told him that wasn't possible as she had used up all of her time off waiting on him for the scheduled appointment window. The tech then never called back, never showed up, and rescheduled us for March 2nd without speaking to my wife to see if she could even be available for that time.\n\nThis morning I called the customer service line and spent 1 hour, 38 minutes, and 12 seconds(this site doesn't allow me to post pics but feel free to review the pic on my reviews on Google, ConsumerAffairs.com, and Facebook) and nothing was accomplished. I spoke to three separate representatives, the first who put me on hold only to transfer me back to the automated menu. I then waited until I could speak to a second person who tried to assist but was unable to. She then transferred me to the escalation department who also wasn't able to assist at all. \n\nHere is a summary of those conversations:\n\nI explained the scenario described above and was apologized to for the technician not showing up. They offered to reschedule our repair for a M-F business hours repair time. I explained that my wife no longer had any time off she could use and I'm still in Phoenix so I cannot be available. I was then told they had no options for after business hours or weekend scheduling and they would schedule us for a time frame during M-F during business hours. Again, I explained that wasn't an option as my wife has no more time she can take off.\n\nThey continued to tell me they wouldn't be able to do anything for us other than try to find a different local company that MIGHT(she couldn't confirm anything as she couldn't reach any of the alternative vendors) be able to make those hours work but the entire process would have to start from the beginning, the review, the part order(because no other vendor would use the part sitting at our house as it came from Sears and not their company - this is normal warranty protocol, I understand that), and the scheduling(which may or may not be the same exact scenario where they can only come out M-F during business hours).\n\nAfter spending 1 hour, 38 minutes, and 12 seconds on the phone the escalations department representative(Vicky) hung up on me and proceeded to push through another order for a smaller company to come out(I never agreed to this) and will now charge us another $75 service fee and start the entire process over. We've already been waiting since 2/4 to get this taken care of. The company refuses to take care of the fee or to work with us on availability after their representative never showed up. This company refuses to help in any tangible way other than to tell us that none of it is their fault.\n\nWorst customer service I have ever dealt with. I am disgusted with this company right now as I've worked in customer service my entire adult life and would never let a scenario like this stand. HSA Home Warranty you need to make good on this scenario.\n\nFeel free to contact me directly as I'd love to come to an amicable solution to this but your company seems unwilling to bend in any way considering we met our part of the deal and my wife wasted her time yesterday waiting on your repair tech who never showed up and she can no longer take the time off required for one of your windows. We have paid our fee, we met our end of the bargain by being available, now it's time for your company to make this right.", "cool": 2, "date": "2017-02-23", "funny": 0, "review_id": "BHwIngKm6tmAiYgd6zU_nA", "business_id": "DWE6wntgvTMXX1-w7IIJOg", "stars": 1, "user_id": "mdmaW-ZOBNsr5gLigKZF4A", "useful": 6}, {"text": "We have only had breakfast to comment on.

The Valley Bar is extremely well placed to enjoy a good walking tour of the town, you won't need to use the buses or taxis as it only takes a few minutes to walk anywhere, enjoy great walks to Horseshoe Bay and further if you like at low tide, and do some fossilling and find yourself some nice carnelian or red jasper, maybe collect some lovely little mother of pearl shells (but check first that they are ones that are not currently occupied by little hermit crabs, you can always see the pincers lurking in the occupied ones), go the other way along the foreshore and around the Marine Drive and up through Peaseholme Park.

His program is a call in format so you never know what questions folks are going to ask but Steve Gregg goes into great detail to ensure the caller understands the answer they seek for their own personal growth so of course that helps us all, Saved and not Saved YET! If you like talk show format you'll love this program! This program is listener sponsored yet no one gets paid on this staff per Mr. Gregg they are all volunteers.  He also offers tons of free downloads, I believe there's over 900 topics at his website AWESOME HUH?\n\nDAYS OF DESTINY\" on Thursdays from 6-7 pm with Pastor Scott Emmert and Evangelist Diana is one of my favs because THEY TEACH AND PREACH THE TRUTH in an easy to LEARN AND REMEMBER unique sort of way.  Pastor Emmert is diligent and fun, Evangelist Diana talks, I don't see notes and well let me say it like this, I believe she either replies to a question the Pastor asks her or she says what The Holy Spirit has layed on her heart for the listeners.  She is ready set and go tell it like it is, she's pretty funny too.  They add some FUN into the mix, you never know what or maybe I should say when; they are going to say something funny, but they will so I try to NEVER MISS THEM because I get THE TRUTH AND LAUGHTER, It's obvious they take their duty serious and they have the fruits of the HOLY SPIRIT, both MEN AND WOMEN OF GOD; as well so  GREAT TEAM FOR JESUS.  I've never heard Pastor Emmert ask for donations, so refreshing as that is, it does take money to be on radio.  I'd sponser if they'd ask or as I'm writing I guess I'd say send it to kkvv and as Fred says; make sure you put Days of Destiny on your check and on the envelope so it goes to their airtime.  They are down to earth, don't believe THE GOSPEL IS FOR SELL so help keep this great team on air because they are afraid to TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH IN GOD'S WRITTEN WORD, HALLELUJUH FOR THAT. HELP IF YOU CAN.\n\nBrends Ward's \"FORGIVEN\" is on air onThursdays from 5-5:30 is so wonderful with this program aiming towards the youth and she has a program about Grandmothers, not sure when that day is but GRANDMA'S RULE AMEN!  RADIO BOOK CLUB is another program that is great with Brenda that features writer's, poets, songwriters, etc. get their testimonies and product out to other's that will benefit.  She does a one on one interview asking ten questions with her guest.  She is a Publisher so check her out too. She's a very nice lady and WOMAN OF GOD!  \n\nAll programs need sponsored with help paying for airtime so we can benefit from their programs on wkkvv. We better keep the GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ON AS LONG AS WE CAN, AS THEY ARE TRYING TO MUZZLE THE PREACHERS AND TEACHERS, EVANGELISTS, TAKING CROSSES DOWN IN THE USA, REALLY? LET'S SUPPORT THESE WHO ARE \"TRULY CALLED\" SO THE UNBLIEVERS CAN GET SOME TRUTH IN THEM AND SOME SOULS CAN BE SAVED. TUNE IN,YOU'LL LOVE IT AT KKVV. AND NO, I DON'T WORK FOR THEM.

I wasn't ready at that point and he followed up and I still wasn't ready. When I became ready, I decided to stop by this dealership for the first time around noon on Saturday, March 21st 2014. That's where I had one of the most unpleasant experiences of any dealership visit that I've ever had.\n\nI had never met Cruz, so when I went in, I had no idea who he was.  I went in through a side door, so I did not immediately see the receptionist. I walked around the dealership, aimlessly, for at least 5 minutes. No one said anything to me. I saw someone and decided to ask if there was a Cruz working, and he replied yes and did not seek to point him out. I finally found the receptionist (Daylin), and she seemed not very friendly and into her phone. She did page Cruz, and I began to wait. 10 minutes later, I asked for him again, and that's when Jacques Deadwiley came over and asked if I was being helped. I told him I was waiting on Cruz, and he attempted to call him on his cellphone. He walked outside and came back in and told me he was with another client, and that he himself would help me.\n\nWe went to a desk, and I told him I only had 30 minutes today, and he said cool. I told him what I was looking for, and he brought in a salesman who took over. He was very nice and began taking my info. Again, I told them I had 30 minutes and had to be somewhere. I had Jacques card, so I planned on calling back after he had my info and I could see what kind of deal he was going to offer. After being there about 45 minutes, I walked over to the glass booth and told them I was leaving, but I would call back in a few. That's where the real problem began.\n\nDawud Muhammad, who I had not spoken to and only know his name based on your website, aggressively threw his hands up and said \"I thought you wanted to buy a car!\" in a condescending tone. I replied \"And this is supposed to entice me?\", referring to his tone and approach. I then walked out to my car. Dawud followed, and as I got in my car and attempted to close the door, he was holding onto my door. I can't really remember all that he was saying, because at this point I was insulted and ready to go. The salesman came out and I told him that I felt Dawud was an a**hole and I asked for the salesman's card. He said he didn't have any on him. After another brief exchange with Dawud, I drove off.\n\nI called Jacques back in 10 minutes, and he asked me why I left. I told him, just as I had originally told him, I had to be somewhere. He replied \"I thought you wanted to buy a car? I had the deal worked out and then you walked off\". I advised that I did and that was why I was calling back. I asked what the deal was. He said he had thrown the numbers away since I left and had to start over. At that time I told him that I felt like he was playing games, and to forget it. He angrily hung the phone up.\n\nThis by far is the worst I have ever been treated by a car dealership. Nissan dealerships in this area and I have never had such a horrible experience.  I have worked in sales before, so I can honestly appreciate an aggressive sales approach. This was over the limit though. You can't talk to and treat people in this manner and expect them to patronize your business. I felt insulted and I think they tried to shame and belittle me in an attempt to push me into continuing to stay there and wait forever. This experience sucked on every level.\n\nS/N: I purchased the car I was looking for at East Charlotte Nissan a few hours after this experience.", "cool": 1, "date": "2014-04-02", "funny": 4, "review_id": "8eLNi_AVoHI6IleGbQq29g", "business_id": "gikE-cNxKdzyZvY3kjFgbg", "stars": 1, "user_id": "HrduXLtltyC8BKy5s4jNQQ", "useful": 9}, {"text": "We cancelled our reservation because of the hosts terrible attitude.

Each wing is 50 cents and deep fried to order.

I got an instant response, saying it was probably a very dry patch in the skin that absorbs more color and she said the technician could fix it easily and provided more instructions on how to maintain specific to my skin. After that it never got splotchy and faded very evenly. Definitely recommend for airbrushing!
