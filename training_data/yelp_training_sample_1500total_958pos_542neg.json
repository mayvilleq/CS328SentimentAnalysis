[{"text": "Back in 2005-2007 this place was my FAVORITE thai place EVER. I'd go here ALLLLL the time. I never had any complaints. Once they started to get more known and got busy, their service started to suck and their portion sizes got cut in half. I have a huge problem with paying MORE for way less food. The last time I went there I had the Pork Pad se Ew and it tasted good, but I finished my plate and was still hungry. I used to know the manager here and she would greet me with a \"Hello Melissa, nice to see you again, diet coke & pad thai or pad se ew?\" Now a days, I know she still knows me but she disregards my presence. Also, I had asked her what was up with the new portion sizes and she had no answer for me. Great food but not worth the money.

The uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'. Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.\n\nWe spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.\n\nAfter a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon & smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.\n\nWhen the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.\n\nBetween the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.\n\nAmazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.\n\nI would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).

Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed \"diner\" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.\n\nStarting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.\n\nThe menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is \"Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50),\" and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!\n\nWe went with the \"Bambamburger ($11.50),\" which is 2/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the \"Bambamburger,\" and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.\n\nBamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.\n\nIf you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.", "cool": 3, "date": "2011-08-01", "funny": 0, "review_id": "BP6XZmb7ugvc1De9mvoQpA", "business_id": "qDguZjZSYPOzq-je_EqO3w", "stars": 4, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "useful": 8}, {"text": "Relatively new to the King West theatre district, and across the street from the Bell Lightbox is, Paese.  New to the neighbourhood, but not new to the restaurant scene, Paese has been operating out of their Bathurst street location since 1989.  Serving up Italian comfort food in a casual but sleek atmosphere, Paese might give longtime district resident Kit Kat some competition.\n\nWith a monochromatic colour scheme, butcher block tables and exposed brick, Paese is very welcoming, even for someone who happened to be dining alone (see: yours truly).\n\nMy server brought the customary bread to the table...but this was no ordinary bread and oil. The bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour.  It came with an olive, rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty.  I tried to stop after one slice, but failed miserably.  I managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't staring at it longingly throughout dinner.\n\nNext, came my Beet Caprese Salad ($13).  Grilled beets came topped with a generous portion of mozzarella di bufala, drizzled with pistachio pesto and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.  The combination of flavours and textures worked well together, and it was just a very fresh salad overall. If seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring.  It was filling enough to be my main course, but I wasn't done yet.\n\nAs full of bread and beets as I was, I couldn't wait for my cavatelli ($13).  Hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasn't as filling.  The sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers, and that's a compliment as although she wasn't Italian, she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the years.\n\nI had initially sent away the wine menu, although I'm not sure why exactly.  Maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and I had another review to do...but those are hardly excuses not to partake.  It's part of the job after all.  Either way, one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table.  Smart man.\n\nPaese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle, they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass.  Now I'm no expert on wine, but I do drink a lot of the stuff so I know what I like, and I like Amarone.  I was given a sample of a 2004 Fumanelli Amarone before committing to a full glass, after which I gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up.  Rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as I'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...\n\nBecause of its location, I probably won't make a repeat visit but I don't think Paese is having a hard time attracting other customers.

We were picked up from the Aria tour bus pickup area, which is underground. Once we picked up a few more people at Excalibur, we were whisked away and headed out of town. A surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures. After this, we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver. Alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test (whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back). All wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality, although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected (no wonder most people gets the red wrong). The first winery we visited was Pahrump Winery. One of the owners, Gretchen, was so very informative and enthusiastic. She was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked. Following a tour and wine tasting, we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch. This lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour. My wife and I, being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines (which I highly recommend). Some of the wines that weren't on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously. We picked out several of our tastings and Gretchen's friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home. We also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to Alan to load onto the bus for us. We were then on the road again and headed to the next winery, I would say that after the first winery, the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience, but I was to be mistaken. The second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and I both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket. As well, the tasting room was a bit \"homey\". I hope they can make it work eventually, but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop. On our way back, Alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink, but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time. I'm not entirely sure that Alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on. I would also encourage Alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing them...if someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery, the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine. Listen enthusiastically and respond positively. Aside from these notes, the tour is great for the value.

When I arrived with my mom that morning, I was greeted promptly by the friendly girl at the desk.  She got basic info from me on what I was looking for/budget/etc.  We then were led to the fitting area with my consultant, Tatiana.  After reviewing what I was looking for, she started to pull a few dresses at a time for me to try on.  She took the time to ask me what I liked and didn't like from each of my dresses.  She was really sweet, professional, and genuine.  I told myself I wasn't going to buy a dress at my first appointment ever...but after 3 hours of trying on dresses, and trying my favorites back on a second time...I selected the gown of my dreams!  Not only was I never rushed, or ever made to feel like I was just a sale, my consultant Tatiana made me feel like an instant friend for the day.  She didn't try to blow through my budget and bring me dresses that were on the high end of my budget - she really did try her best to make me feel amazing and beautiful.  I ended up picking a dress that wasn't even what I had in mind - and I'm so glad for it!  The manager was also very polite and my mom and I were happy she took the time to introduce herself to us.  Yes the store had other brides, and yes there were others looking in the mirrors, and yes my consultant had to split her time...but it's such an exciting moment - I didn't realize how much time was passing, and it took some pressure off to not have her there standing by me the whole time, allowing me to talk to my mom about each dress.  As someone who also works in guest service, I can tell you Tatiana was great at multi-tasking - she gave me all the time I needed, and when she was working with me, she had her focus completely on me.  When I came back to the store a few weeks later to pick up my ordered sash, I had another great experience!  The lady at the desk this time also greeted me, and helped me find the headpieces (since I now wanted to try them on too)!  A consultant who was in the area was really kind, and he asked me if I needed help, and offered suggestions for what I was looking for.  When I finally made my way to the counter an pick up what I was actually there to get (my order), the manager and consultant there were both great...I am honestly blown away with it all, because I know it's rare to find that level of incredible service from a large chain.

So much so that I feel obligated in writing my first Yelp review in the five years since I've been a member.. \n\nThis is how the story goes:\n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8/26 to watch the Mayweather/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get \"unexpectedly\" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd. \n\nAt this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. \n\nSo we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow. \n\nSo then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.\n\nIt's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone. \n\nSo officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins.....\n*This review will be updated as soon as I hear back from someone.*\n\nNOTE: This entire situation has been a mess, and if the owners/leaders of this establishment had any sense of integrity towards their patrons, they would make this right!", "cool": 0, "date": "2017-08-30", "funny": 2, "review_id": "EwqGnKBArhiHxGLzvfHBlg", "business_id": "DMmeFKsUuMl0kDy7Zd7W3A", "stars": 1, "user_id": "IbYh87kbTZTPbD4ICCZ7vw", "useful": 3}, {"text": "The portions are very generous - there is definitely enough to take home for a second dinner.", "cool": 0, "date": "2016-11-16", "funny": 0, "review_id": "sV7h92qVg5vEZ1ZgP2_5QQ", "business_id": "G8k2E3oYHHl2o4lNJQwR-g", "stars": 4, "user_id": "oFV2JnphVxgUlPLdCQwlLg", "useful": 0}, {"text": "Never shopping there again after two recent terrible experiences.

Also my cousin had stated that she had extra skin that is near her fingernail so it was already cut to wear she wanted it but the owner insisted she knew what she was doing and that she will cut it.  On top of it, she did not massage my hands nor my foot.  Shows that she really doesn't listen to her customers.  What is nice was the paraffin feet and hand that she provided.\n \n2) Then we went into the massage/facial room.  I was given the back scrub first and my cousin was given the facial.  My back scrub was fine.  My cousin's facial was fine for the most part.  Now the funny thing is, so she gave me 20 minutes to relax and then came into the room to wake me up.  I do not think her assistant knew what she was doing for she kept asking the owner what to do.  Then, she told me I had to go shower!  What????  So she stood there in the massage room while I was naked trying to get on my robe (weird). So...she took me to a bathroom down the hall..the bathroom was so disgusting and I had to get up in the stand up shower to rinse off my back  and the paraffin hand/foot treatment.  While I was in the gross disgusting stand up shower, barefoot-keep in mind, the woman opens the door and asks if everything is okay.  Who does that??\n \n3) After the shower, I came back and sat in the massage room.  She told me to lay down again and she gave me I guess at most a 15 minute \"moroccan massage\"-which was not relaxing at all.  And on top of that her hands slipped and punched me in the cheeks.\n \n4) Facial was okay.  I don't think the towel they put on me was a clean towel.  I felt like it was the same towel that was probably from my feet.  The facial was nothing spectacular and it did not serve it's justice.\n \nI really, really had a bad experience with this massage place.  I feel mostly bad for my cousin because she's never been to a day spa.  What she experienced is not a good impression of what a dayspa should really be.  She was not a licensed massage therapist but yet she wants to do all services.  If you are not experienced..you should not do it.  It says on there she was a licensed podology.  She kept pushing her product line and repeatedly informed her that we were not interested.  At one point, I told her I was from the states and that I was flying home so I wouldn't be able to carry all the products onto the plane.  She suggested that I send it through the post office..ummm I don't think so.  It would cost alot of money to send out of the country.  And last but not least her hidden fees.  So I guess this living social deal did not include the taxes.  She charged 13% for Canadian taxes and then an automatic service fee (which I think is a bunch of bullshit since it was crappy services) of 17%.  So we already paid 99.00 for the services and then forced 30.00 for fees/services?  Really??  \n\nI don't think I will be going back....", "cool": 1, "date": "2011-10-12", "funny": 0, "review_id": "STP2dkU2UGfeZqgj3cKqMw", "business_id": "zBN0QWgGeeVJ4gF3UeLo6w", "stars": 1, "user_id": "ZRqLxkrnP1T8dVCs26X41Q", "useful": 0}, {"text": "The management doesn't care about the health or well-being of their residents.

Even with a line, it didn't take long for the boyfriend to put down an order, so don't be afraid to line up!! \n\nWe recently came back from a trip to Seattle and just loved the clam chowder at pike place market.

You can taste the clams although it got kind of watery half way through. It didn't feel very hearty to me as there wasn't many chunks of clams or potatoes or what have you. Though, It's a pretty decent chowder. \n\n* Haddock and chips: I'm not a big fan of the fish and chips here at buster's. The batter is light, but it doesn't have much taste to it. The batter was also not crispy. The haddock itself, is a little dry. I was expecting it to be a tougher texture, but it shouldn't feel dry. Also not much seasoning. Kind of reminds me of fish filets/fish sticks that come in a box in the frozen aisle. The fries, were definitely not made fresh (even with the lineup?!). They weren't crispy nor too soggy. Saving grace was their tartar sauce, it tasted home made and gave the fish some flavour. It also comes with a little container of slaw. \n\nAll in all, my experience here at buster's st Lawrence market was only so-so (food wasn't as fresh and service was a little rushed).

My friend disagrees saying that it's just make it too soggy but I think it'd be great. I think I will request that addition next time, if possible. I like tomatoes on everything though...\n\nThe Beach ($10)\nChick pea salad, roasted coconut, yakinori, sesame, sprouts, and cheddar on dark rye\nNot bad, a decent healthy sandwich. The chickpeas were chickpeas, the sprouts were sprouts - I got exactly what I ordered. While tasty, I won't be craving it anytime soon and I'd sooner try something else off of their menu.\n\nThe Fish Fry ($14)\nGolden fried Ontario Rainbow Trout, with a dandelion & avocado mixed green salad, white vinaigrette.\nThe Rainbow Trout was well done, although I wish there was more to the salad. I wonder how much it would have cost to upgrade to the Greens with Envy salad? Purple kale, dandelion, cucumber, green onion, sprouts, and broccoli sounds pretty darn good.\n\nThe following two items come with sandwiches, or you can order them separately.\nSoupe de Soleil ($4)\nThe butternut squash and was thick, filling, and satisfying. I actually like my squash soups a bit chunky so I was quite happy with this homey bowl. There was also a bit of tomato & scallions and possibly carrot, if I recall correctly. Yum.\n\nBlack Beans ($6)\nThe black bean dip with avocado was also tasty with the red tortilla chips. Dense and chunky, the bowl was spooned clean. I wished there were a few more large chips in the pile, but no biggie - I just scooped some dip with my spoon with the little chip bits. In hindsight, I think I would've liked this in the sandwich too!\n\nJulies' Pies!\nOoh...pie. With Wanda's Pie in the Sky down the street I was surprised to see \"Julies' Pie\" for dessert. I racked my poor memory for a bakery named Julie's and drawing a blank, I asked where/who Julie('s) is. It turns out that one of the owner's (Ryan) cousin's wife bakes yummy desserts for their cafe. Talk about family love :) It was a sweltering hot day, but he convinced me that the pie was \"reaaaalllly good\" with a knowing \"omg\" look on his face. Not that my sweet tooth ever needs much convincing anyways.\n\nAnd \"reaaaallly good\" it was! Totally catering to my not-so-secret love affair with Ontario peaches, the filling was just the right amount of sweet and the crust (which I think is just as important!) was nice and soft. While my friend said he would've preferred more of a \"bite\" for both the peaches and the crust, I was quite satisfied as I liked the super-soft pieces of fruit. Mmmm. It wasn't syrupy or overloaded with sugar. This pie-lover was satisfied.\n\nThe service from co-owner Chris was very friendly and conversational. I heard they were going to offer fish tacos at yesterday's Pedestrian Sundays however a combination of a precarious weather forecast and something about the cousin who was going to cook 'em up made it a no-go. I must have looked crest-fallen as I got a consoling tap on the shoulder from Ryan (is it creepy that I'm using their first names as if I know them?) and a promise of their appearance on August 29th's Pedestrian Sunday. Sadly I will be out of town, but as a fanatic of Little Italy's Fish Store, at least I know where to get my fish-fix. Pout.\n\nOverall, I had a good time at The Bellevue. While there were some things that I would like to tweak, everything tasted good and homey. The items are things that I could easily make at home, but the creative combinations certainly stirred my imagination. It won't be long before I start making my own Sardine-Nut Butter-Rye sandwiches...which may or may not be pleasant for The Bellevue to hear!", "cool": 1, "date": "2010-09-16", "funny": 0, "review_id": "vfZBD6pHfdGg6A_9FsFT5A", "business_id": "3Zgo3Fi1DayoSkm89NweKA", "stars": 4, "user_id": "WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA", "useful": 1}, {"text": "Flophouse. \n\nFormerly the Imperial Palace, only the name has changed.

We discussed what we wanted with Tim and left to draw an initial plan.   Days later Tim emailed a basic plan and a video of his ideas, So far So Good.   In the meantime we contacted a couple of much larger pool companies, including one that we had used before and has a very good reputation.   Its a good thing we did as the other companies check the codes and found setbacks restrictions that Tim was unaware of.   Due to the research of the other pool companies, we had Tim redraw the plan with those setbacks in mind, as well as some other ideas.   This happened on a number of plan iterations, where another pool company would have a great idea and we would share that idea with Tim to incorporate into our plan.   There were many differences in design quality such as AZ Rainfall uses Alumawood for their Ramadas as opposed to building from scratch like all other builders.   We informed Tim that we would have to check with our association as their rules required similar building materials as the original residence.   All of the sudden I get a call from Tim Brown saying they didn't have the time to send a final plan for approval by the HOA, without which we could not get approval.\nIt appears that this well over $100,000.00 job was no longer of interest to AZR.

We just moved to Anthem from Dallas Texas and were looking for a great pizza/Italian place to eat at, but this is NOT the place.

We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \"kitchen\" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!  So we simply told her to cancel the order and we would just pay for the pizza and wine and be happy to leave.  It was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had.  The \"manager\" was there, tending a small bar, at which NO ONE was sitting, but he did manage to go and clean the back door glass while all of his customers were waiting for service.  It was a totally dysfunctional, totally unacceptable experience and I doubt that we will ever return, unless my wife bets me that it couldn't possible be that bad on a second visit and I might be willing to accept that \"sure bet\"!!!

He came to see my possessions that same day so that he could give me a realistic quote to move them. He 100% stuck to the quote given as well as sent over a contract to nail everything down in stone.\n\nFor all the little details, from giving me a ton of boxes, arranging for a storage facility just in case, sending over four super impressive movers, and granting all my wishes for the move, it grew to an extraordinary experience. There was not one phone call not answered, question not addressed, and complication not resolved instantly. Additionally, if I was not thrilled enough with Jeff, his skilled movers tipped the scale to having absolutely no doubt that I made the right decision to use One Price Moving. They not only moved, installed, built, hung, and addressed absolutely every item that needed it until all was perfectly in place, but did everything with a smile on their faces and great work ethic.

The scallops were good but the risotto was just acceptable and nothing to write home about. The Tortelli, on the other hand, was definitely forgettable.

Between the personal recommendations and the fawning of the print and online food community, the decision wasn't too hard to make to try it out. (The fact that it was voted one of the best new restaurants of 2011 by Toronto Life definitely didn't hurt.)\n\nWe popped into Kalendar for a drink beforehand (check out the rojo martini if you go. Most excellent.) and watched the world go by, including the chef of Grace, Top Chef Canada contestant Dustin Gallagher. Mental note: must get to Grace! We wandered over to Woodlot and as soon as we opened the door, the aroma from that spectacular wood-burning oven wafted over us. Figuring that was a good sign, we inhaled deeply and sat down at our cozy table. The restaurant looks like it seats about 50 on the upper floor with room for another 10 or so downstairs at the chef's table. The exposed brick walls are adorned with native Canadian art as well as knickknacks that lend a cottage-like vibe to the place. The waiters are dressed casually and it is explained to us that there is a standard menu, plus a separate vegetarian menu. I perused it quickly and was impressed to find a nice selection that didn't fit into the standard roast-veg-or-pasta options.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of cabernet franc and eventually settled on three courses: the scallop ceviche with black quinoa, whipped avocado and julienned red cabbage; Red Fife whole wheat papardelle with wood mushrooms and hazeluts; whey-fed pork chop with grilled treviso, tri-tip steak with caramelized onions and side of Jerusalem artichokes.\n\nWhen the bread basket arrived at the table after placing our order, we jumped right in. My dining companion loves bread and watching his face light up after taking that first bite of the gorgeous Red Fife bread was wonderful! I'd read about this particular grain in Sara Elton's book, Locavore, and was excited to check it out. It kind of makes regular bread taste entirely pathetic. We'd both had a couple of pieces of the various kinds when the appetizer arrived. The scallops were soft, the avocado was whipped into a lovely, airy bubble and these textures were complimented well with the crunchy quinoa and cabbage. I wish there'd been more of it, but we weren't exactly going to starve.\n\nNext up was the papardelle which was out of this world. Again, the Red Fife made a huge difference in terms of flavour. The wide, handmade noodles were cooked perfectly and provided much more dimension to the dish than you'd have otherwise. It was a very earthy plate, one that you wanted to hunker down with in front of a fire and never stop eating. I hope that's on the menu year 'round, because I would have it again and again.\n\nThe service at Woodlot is quite good, if not entirely exceptional. Importantly, however, they let you enjoy your meal in peace and the timing in between courses is well paced. We needed a little time between the hearty pasta and giant slabs of meat that would imminently arrive at our table. And giant slabs of meat they were: delicious, juicy, perfectly-cooked pieces of meat. My pork chops had that little layer of fat around the outside that you know you probably shouldn't eat, but can't help yourself because you know how good it is. The grilled treviso was a perfect compliment, too. The steak was exactly medium-rare as  ordered and was incredibly tender. The caramelized onions were an excellent accompaniment - in fact, I'd eat a whole bowl of those if they sold them. Even the Jerusalem artichokes were great - caramelized and not overcooked.\n\nTo say that we savoured every bite is not an understatement. Nothing was complicated (though I have a spot in my heart for complex food) or overwrought: in fact, we saw several dishes come out on wooden cutting boards. Dessert was very tempting, but we passed this time. I'd like to go back in the cooler months as I'm dying to try the marrow-infused whipped potatoes.  Of course, I also want to go back so I can eat ALL the bread that's there.\n\nSo there you have it. Great food, cozy and welcoming atmosphere. It's tough to get reservations on a weekend, but the hostess with whom I spoke to make our reservations was gracious and as accommodating as could be.

The Sunday before my trip, I went to this location for a petite set. I was given a packet of materials, and part of it said to get your lashes done at least a few days before an event. Lucky me, I thought, because I was going about 4 days before leaving. I figured my lashes would last for at least a few weeks and then I'd have to get a touch up to just fill in empty spots. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nFirst of all, the woman who worked on my eyes must not have washed her hands. I could smell a strong peanut butter smell, and those little latex finger things they use didn't help. \n\nSecond, my lashes lasted for less than a week and a half, despite me following their instructions to the letter. I didn't wear any eye makeup for several days before, I didn't wash my eyes the day I got them and for a couple of days after, and I barely wore any eye makeup at all and definitely did not use mascara. When I did wear eye makeup, I used makeup remover that was oil free and meant for lash extensions. I was on vacation but didn't swim or submerge my head. When I took a shower, I kept my face out of the water at all times. Even with me being extremely careful, every time I blinked another lash would fall off. By the end of the week they were 90% gone.\n\nI was extremely disappointed with the lashes.

The place has a real old rustic feel to it, almost like you're standing in your grandma's kitchen. This is achieved by the thick wooden rusty tables and the wooden cabinet littered with books and interesting knickknacks.  The kitchen is an open one with a floral pattern dress wearing chef cooking frantically behind it. We were a bit put off that she wasn't wearing a hair net but let it slide. One thing I liked though was that this place had proper ventilation, so you don't leave smelling like the food as was the case at Mitzi's Caf\u00e9. We also loved that it was hidden in a nice, quiet residential area, always a favorite!  \n\nWe noticed that there was only one server on duty, which made the service less than impressive, but god bless her she was doing her very best. You couldn't really blame the server for this but instead the management for allowing one server on duty on a busy Sunday afternoon (the place was packed). Once seated we were served water right away and asked about our beverage orders to which we all said we'd have coffee. The coffee was the best damn coffee I've ever had in my life! And I've tried various kinds in my day between living in Europe and here. I even went to the trouble of taking down the name of the brand. As the service was quite slow, we had to re-fill our own coffee cups from the coffee station as well as our own water, which actually made the whole brunch experience more interactive as you almost felt like you were in a friend's kitchen helping yourself.  \n\nI ordered the salmon/goat cheese breakfast wrap ($11), while the rest of the table ordered their own choices (all different). I have to comment on the freshly cut Paeonia arrangement in the middle of the table, my friend and I couldn't stop sticking our noses into them. The washroom was quite small but clean. Our meals came out 45 minutes after ordering but were delicious! The goat cheese complimented the salmon extraordinarily well; I was surprised at myself that I've never tried this type of pairing before. The rest of my table also expressed like for their meals. I was a bit disappointed though with the bland salad on the side. Although the leaves were all very rich in color, the dressing was nothing special.\n\nThe total bill for the two of us was $35.

When I contacted Martin Vet to set up the procedure and provided them with his medical records no one responded to set up an appointment for over a week. After calling back and speaking with multiple staff, I finally heard back from Dr. Conway herself at 7 pm on New Year's Eve.\n\nShe called me on the verge of hysterics insisting that despite the referral from my general vet from a dental visit completed a week ago, and the urgent needs of my dog she needed to first examine the dog and charge for a consultation before scheduling an actual appointment.

So, I would have to wait another two weeks to treat my dogs dental needs.\n\nSince my dog recently just had a wellness exam, and the medical records were provided to the office, I asked if the consultation fee could be waived once I paid for the dental procedures and sedation. To my knowledge all medical professionals are expected to examine a patient prior to sedating them when asked regarding this issue, Dr. Conway angrily stated \"No, the day of the procedure we just check their temperature.\" This was very concerning to me and I would not seek care from an establishment that sedates dogs without doing a thorough work up the day of the procedure. \n\nAs a dentist for humans, I can tell you that without radiographs a dental diagnosis/consultation cannot be given, so billing for a dental consult without radiographs and then billing again another separate fee for a dental exam under sedation, is unethical. No dental diagnosis can be obtained without radiographs. As well, it goes without saying that if anyone sedates your pet - a thorough exam should be conducted by the anesthesiologist performing the sedation, all medical records reviewed the day of the procedure rendering the consult performed by Dr. Conway unnecessary and inhumane as it delays the ability for a pet to be treated in a timely and compassionate manner.

Fast forward many years later and I'm glad to find that there is an excellent choice for Vietnamese food a quick hop from my current abode.\n\nI've been to dine at Saigon Palace close to a dozen times and it has been consistently good. The staff has been friendly, the service great, and the food has been extremely tasting and satisfying. The Pho is quite good as is the Bun. Also, the quail appetizer is outstanding. I did manage to make it to their Sunday buffet lunch which was very cool. It was packed and the place was buzzing with families and large groups happily chowing down and enjoying the food and conversation.

After hearing great things from fellow students, I decided to drop in to get my ears pierced. \n\nI had had my ears pierced previously, but they closed up because I never wore earrings.  It was too much of a hassle to bring my mommy in with me to get a simple piercing, so I waited until I was 18 to get the piercing done.  I went in on my birthday and upon seeing my ID, the guy at the counter wished me \"happy birthday.\"  I know that's not a big deal, but it definitely created a good vibe and little things like that in a skeptical situation can make a big difference.  \n\nThere were people still waiting to get their piercings done, so I had to wait a bit before I was shown the jewelry.  After I picked my earrings out, I had to wait even longer to be escorted into a room.  I'd say overall, the wait time was probably about an hour.  I don't think that's Blue Lotus's fault, though.  It was busy, and people had appointments, and I did not.  \n\nEventually I was taken back into a room by Myke.  He was very kind and thorough in explaining to me what was going to be done and making sure that I knew how clean the whole process was.  He washed his hands and changed his gloves numerous times and even though I'm a bit crazy about germs, I felt completely comfortable.  \n\nI turned out that my hole hadn't completely closed up, and Myke was able to just insert something through my ear the opened the hole back up.  There was a bit of pain, but nothing bad by any means.  I'm very afraid of needles, so I began to get dizzy when the first ear was done.  He kept asking me if I was okay throughout the entire process, and when I told him I was dizzy, he was extremely understanding and finished the other ear with my lying down.  After the piercings were done, he had me check in the mirror and explained to me the steps to take in the weeks to come.\n\nI didn't get a tattoo or a major piercing, but I can testify that the Blue Lotus staff, especially Myke, is professional, kind, and extremely careful about cleanliness and sanitation.

They don't accept reservations no matter what the occasion, and there's almost always a wait. I've yet to figure out why, because it's really not all that. Unfortunately, I have friends who like it, and my polite requests to go elsewhere aren't always properly considered.\n\nOregano's relies on gimmicks--swing music, gigantic menus that are awkward to hold, and cutesy names for the pizzas.

His mixes were also fantastic and he ended the night on a super high note for us.\n\nWe also went with photography and lighting services through them.

Everything on the menu is fresh and, as much as possible, local. I travel solo all of the time and I prefer Kimpton Hotels because they tend to have REAL restaurants in them, not hotel restaurants.\n\nThe ambiance is great and everyone is friendly (esp when you stay here in summer and the place is empty). But let's talk about the food......\n\nOn my first visit here a few months ago, I had the margherita pizza and the rucola salad. Either I was starving or it really was the best pizza I'd had in a long time. On my second trip here, I got the butternut squash ravioli in brown butter with fried sage - melt in your mouth pasta. It's made in house and it puts all dried pasta in my cupboard to shame.\n\nThis trip, I ate at Taggia twice because I am just too damn lazy to look for other places to eat when I have this place just across the pool. I returned to the margherita pizza again after starting with the asparagi antipasti. Both were delightful, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the trevigiana cheese in the asparagi dish, so now I know. The pizza wasn't quite as insanely delicious as it was the first time, but I still really enjoyed it. Great crust and great sauce.\n\nIn the spirit of being repetitive, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli again and started with the two gazpachos - on one side of the bowl, a summer melon gazpacho, and the other side, a tomato gazpacho. Both were fully pureed (no chunks of anything) and good; however, there was too much sugar in both. Still, I cleaned my plate, because under the sugar (or was it too much salt? something was too much) the fresh flavors popped.\n\nI'll be back. In like 2 weeks.

Growing up a mangiacake in Little Italy over 30 years ago (when there weren't that many of us) I had no idea how special it was. It was just the place in the 'hood to get your veals. Me and my younger brother used to spend our allowance money on veal sandwiches, walking a couple blocks past Sicilian Ice cream, or other sweets vendors, as we valued the sandwiches more highly. Now, having seen more of the world and sampled its fare, I have a deep appreciation for the simplicity and quality of the sandwiches there. I don't know exactly why they taste better than any other Italian sandwiches but there is apparently some serious alchemy going on in the back with the fat ladies banging pots and hollering in Italian.  Those sandwiches are certainly for my money tastier and more satisfying than any gourmet panini with soft cheese and unpronounceable mushroom. \n\nThis locale retains a fair amount of its authenticity despite a half-hearted superfluous reno years ago. Nobody goes here for decor, service or ambiance, although the unapologetic lack of these is part of its charm. They come for sandwiches, and my mouth is filling up with saliva just thinking about it. No use describing it, just get one. \n\nAs a family man now living further west I don't get here often, and while the franchised facsimiles don't compare with the authenticity, I have to admit they seem to have a bit of it and the sandwiches are good.

When talking about filling the car up before bringing it back I was informed that the gas rate for them to fill the car back up was $2.17 and I said no we will fill it up. She informed me that I have to fill it up within 10 miles of the airport and have to bring a receipt and the receipt will show whether or not it was within 10 miles. I said that's fine we'll take care of it, $2.17 is expensive and she looked at me like I was an idiot so I asked her how much gas was in Charlotte and she stated that it was only a couple cents different which is a lie. Gas was $1.89 at 99% of the stations we saw except for the one right across the street from the airport.

The dry rub was quite unique, not horrible but def not anything to rave about. We also had the pork belly sliders. This one item was the favorite of the evening. We opted to not have the pimento cheese on there and that was probably for the best. I'm not sure why but a lot of the items seemed to have pimento cheese.....\n \nSo I had the steak sandwich. Not a fan at all. There was too much going on. I actually had one item taken off of the sandwich and it was still too much. It was really messy and not enjoyable to eat. \nWe also had the roast turkey. Seemed dry to me but that's not really anything new with turkey. It came with hummus but we opted for it to be on the side. Honestly I don't think it would have added anything to the sandwich. In addition we tried the burger. Meh. The FF though were quite delicious. \n\nI will say that the menu is limited and seemed overly crowded somehow. Each dinner item had so many ingredients and none of it really drew me in.

I have recommended this hotel to several friends who are looking for a place to stay when taking their kids to Carowinds.. \n\nAfter this last stay, I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL AGAIN.\n\nok, so here is what happened. We checked in Friday afternoon, took our things to the room, changed our clothes and headed to the park for some fun.. came back around 8 p.m. and noticed our T.V. was not working.. A fine gentlemen came up tried to fix it, could not fix it, and got us a new room.. not an issue, he was prompt polite, and solved the issue quickly, switching the room was not a problem.\n\nSaturday get up, eat some breakfast, return to the room, knock on the door, it was housekeeping, i told them we would leave the room around 10, she asked if we needed service, i said yes please, just please make the beds, and new towels and amenities in the bathroom that would be great, and off to the Water Park we went.. \n\nWe came back around 2:30, room was not done by housekeeping, but we knew that someone had been in the room, because the TV channel had changed from the kids programming.. My wife wanted to take a shower so she went down to the front desk to get some towels, and was told to find housekeeping.. She asked why our room was not done, and was told housekeeping does new checkins first, and then does stay-overs second.. This sounds a little backward to me but ok.. our room was not done..\n\nNext we put our kids down for naps, since we were going to go back to the park that evening.. Our kids could not nap because housekeeping kept yelling up and down the hallway.. I asked several times for them to please be quite, and was completely ignored. I tried to call the front desk, but the phone did not work, so I went down to the front desk, and yes i was a little upset, I asked to speak with management and was told she was management, I explained the situation and was told that there was a Family Reunion in town and that was where the noise was coming from. I stated no, this was housekeeping. she proceeded to argue with me on who was causing the noise. I said I wanted to speak to the owner, she gave me an 800 number to call, I returned to my room, and called the 800# and was on hold for 20 minutes. \n\nThen for the next hour there was 4 knocks on the door, when i opened the door, there was no one there, but the housekeepers cart was right next door.. I figured it was payback for complaining. Our room never was cleaned, my children were unable to take naps, no apology was ever given.  \n\nI have to add that they did refund $27 of my $150 bill, apparently this is the appropriate refund when your room does not get serviced, you do not have any amenities, you have continuous arguments with their employees and management, and they do not let your kids nap.\n\nWE ARE DONE WITH CHOICE HOTELS, AND WILL NEVER STAY OR RECOMMEND CHOICE HOTELS AGAIN!!!!!", "cool": 0, "date": "2016-08-18", "funny": 0, "review_id": "k0tICpe_I_U1Rfv9lbVgJw", "business_id": "rrux602t3O8aPUuOcB6i4A", "stars": 1, "user_id": "fp8WFACrJuxUvrzuVQ1Stg", "useful": 0}, {"text": "just stayed at the stratosphere for 10 days.......and my room was very clean...bed was comfortable . pretty helpful and attentive staff.great price (except the extra $200+ resort fee) we also enjoyed the pin up show...and the fact they turn the theatre into a great spot to watch nfl games on sunday.....AAA++++...i'll b back", "cool": 0, "date": "2014-09-26", "funny": 1, "review_id": "uQI07i-gboOX0fzhS_uwkA", "business_id": "ByFMv3p5X1aNeZhU61rDcA", "stars": 4, "user_id": "8HaK2BDUTikim7jNXTW1nQ", "useful": 0}, {"text": "It's the most surprisingly good cuisine that I've tasted in any Montreal restaurant!

My family and I have eaten there often but this last trip was a disappointment.

Maybe that's imagination, maybe the H'ville location has me spoiled. Still, it's not what I remember from PDQ Concord.

Usually they are too hot to eat without some cool down. Not so this time. The flavor was right but smaller and just warm = no bueno.\n\nAnd the fries were objectively unusual too. They were limp and a tad oily instead of their usual crispy. Luke warm, not hot.

PROMISE TO REFUND PART OF YOUR MONEY AND NEVER DO. STEER CLEAR OF WEST COAST MOVERS OF LAS VEGAS.\n\nWe were looking to have a stress free move from Henderson, NV to North Carolina as promised by Britany at West Coast Movers in Las Vegas. What a disaster it turned out to be. Britany came out and did a walk thru estimate which we thought was a bit high but our least expensive estimate so we went with West Coast. She is a charming lady who makes you feel so at ease. Don't buy the act! The day of our move, the packers had very little to do since I had boxed and packed most everything. Britany had bragged about me doing all the hard work and so did the moving foreman, I think his name was TJ. Anyway, the packers could not speak a word of English, when you spoke to them they just smiled. TJ had to translate some of the important things that I wanted them to do. The furniture was wrapped real quickly and we thought fairly professional. TJ gave us papers to sign on all the inventory of our furniture and boxes and said that the price may change a little but it shouldn't be that much, that he had a pretty good eye about these things. What a joke! They won't actually give you an exact figure until everything is loaded on the truck so you are at their mercy. Once the truck was completely loaded the price of our move increased by $2300.00. I don't know about you but for us; we are on a fixed income, that was like slitting our throats. After finding out this new amount, we literally had to borrow money from others to be able to get our furniture across country to our new home. Cost up front is half by cash or personal check. At your destination, you must pay cash or Postal Money Order; which means you have to buy about 3 money orders because the post office doesn't sell money orders over $1000.00.\n\nWhen Britany took our deposit, she tells us that she would make certain that our furniture would arrive as close to our move in date as possible. When your furniture is already loaded on the truck, the foreman tells you it could take up to 5 weeks, no guarantee on the delivery date. Just another way of making your move more stressful.\n\nWe got to NC on the 21st of January. We stayed in a motel and at my sisters a few nights then tried sleeping on the floor at the new house. We called West Coast Movers for several days and left messages. No one called us back until finally I left an email message letting Britany know how unhappy we were with West Coast Movers. The truck driver called us and told us when we should expect them, then Britany called and wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise. I finally said would you please stop and let me talk. She was telling me that she was brought up right and that she wouldn't work for a company that she didn't believe in. Please!\n\nOur furniture arrived and even though our driveway is about 3-4 times the length of the tracker trailer, the driver said he couldn't bring it into our driveway. First that he couldn't get it in our driveway, second the DOT wouldn't allow him to bring it on our driveway that it might cause damage. His helper said we could sign a waver but the driver said no. He wanted to charge us extra to bring it up to the house. I told him we weren't paying an extra dime that it wasn't our fault that he couldn't and wouldn't park in our driveway. After getting heated over this, both myself and the driver, he said that they would carry the stuff 75 feet and drop it there and refused to go any farther. I told him that they weren't getting their money and he said you don't get your belongings. I called West Coast Movers in Nevada and spoke with Ashley who was really kind and seemed to care about our situation.  She spoke to the driver and asked that they wave the charge of  the extra steps to get to the house and move the contents into the house and set it up as we had paid for. The driver wasn't happy at all but they started to move the furniture and boxes into the house. As they began, I noticed how horribly packed the stuff was in the truck so I went out and started taking pictures. The driver immediately stopped working and called West Coast and said my husband was helping unload the truck and that I was taking pictures. Ashley called me after that conversation and said that wasn't acceptable and my husband needed to stop and wanted to know why I was taking pictures. I explained my reason and she said that they couldn't stop me from taking the pictures but not to worry, they were working to get us a refund on our move due to our experience being so unpleasant. Up to that point the experience with West Coast had been horrible and you would think it couldn't get any worse. It did! We had to sign the paper saying we received all our goods; which at that point we had no idea since it was about 9:00 at night and we were exhausted after such a long day.\n\nCan't finish too many characters for Yelp.", "cool": 0, "date": "2014-02-13", "funny": 0, "review_id": "05l3rdB0DBViwAubq7LjoA", "business_id": "ruFgApclJ4Mo3qEUwcklyA", "stars": 1, "user_id": "LGhI86Z4yI4XvNe0HXi_jw", "useful": 6}, {"text": "I'm so livid about this companies inability to properly schedule a service call, I could only imagine what their quality of work would be like.

When we got there that was not the case. We had to wait for about 20-30 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us and then when they did they gave us the keys to test drive the car, alone- not telling us a single thing about the car. When we got back from the test drive we were met with a sales guy who finally told us a little about the car and agreed it had some quirks (Messed up leather seat, no backup camera, odd controls but this was a Volvo and they are a Nissan dealership so we didn't question him too much)\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of looking around in the car we decided to start the negotiation ( we had been looking for this particular car and so it didn't take much for us to decide). We headed inside to start the process. \n\nWe started our offer low- who doesn't at a car dealership and they were \"offended\" and didn't think they could make it work. After back and forth we decided to walk away from the car. They were rude and basically impossible to work with so we decided to leave and were ok with finding another car to avoid working with them. \n\nThe next day they sent me 2 texts and called me several times \"wanting to make things work\" so we offered 23,500 ALL CASH and we would pick up the car within a matter of hours (the car was listed at 23,339 + tag and fees which totaled 24,400). After getting no where with them because they didn't budge on price after calling me and wanting to make it work we offered 24,000 all cash (we are now 400 dollars apart) and they said no...\n\nI finally said forget it because they were so rude and disrespectful but they KEPT CALLING ME offering 24,300 and then 24,200- At this point I was so offended that they came down 100 dollars and I said heck no and walked away.\n\nIn summary, I would NEVER recommend this dealership to anyone.

The therapist told me I had scoliosis which nobody has every told me and I know for a fact (after a quick dr visit when I got home) that I don't! When I asked her to press firmer she said no, and only massaged from below shoulder blades to above lower. To top it off for $150 massage the automatically put the gratuity on before your service so you walk out at $190 for a 50 minute massage. I never write bad reviews...but please please don't waist your money.

There's been so many positive reviews about this company that my negative experience is made all the more disappointing.  But alas, my outing was undeniably lacking.  To set the stage, I purchased some coupon vouchers for an Introductory Sail Trip for a bachelor party in August I was planning (yes, belated review...I've been busy!)  The invitees had no experience with any sort of sailing, save for one late-comer with mostly novice-level experience, so no expectations were initially set (other than the trip description).  It led to discussions before, during and after the trip.  Sadly, it didn't improve the outcome of this experience.  Here are the main issues:\n\n1.  Booking\n\n- Online booking is on an individual basis.  So if you're booking for a large group, you end up signing everybody up one by one.  It took me about an hour to get a party of 5 signed up.\n- They don't seem to keep track of your online waivers.  So when we actually got to the boat, we still got asked if we had signed.  So if I were to ever do this again -- which I definitely won't -- I'l be skipping the online waiver.\n\n2.  Sailing Experience\n\n- Firstly, ship was clean.  Nobody tripped, nothing stunk.  However...\n- Set sail late, docked early.  I don't think we even got 3 hours out of this 3.5 hr trip\n- Poor trip planning.  Three individuals did not get to steer, all three came from our party of five.  You would think that unless anyone stated any apathy towards the steering/hands-on component of the trip (which no one did), a competent (or unbiased) planner would divide the time at the wheel evenly amongst the nine guests.  He did walk from stern to bow to ask one of the other parties to try the steering, so it's not clear why the other three weren't asked in a similar way.\n- Not funny/entertaining?  I know, completely subjective, shouldn't belong here.  But it was really weird:\na. the captain ended up grabbing my leg through the cabin window, I think with the intent to make it seem like a shark bite.  There was no other answer when I had asked him about it afterwards.\nb. Around the midway point, he had asked if everybody was having fun, and invited those who weren't to approach him; followed by a reminder of the 250 ft. waters surrounding the boat.  That would've been funny, IMHO, if everybody was actually having fun, instead of waiting for their turn to steer...\nc. After we had docked, i.e. when the sailing was over, he had provided a pirate hat and plastic sword for the groom to pose in.  Ignoring the question of why this wasn't provided before or during the sail, why it was thought that this would have looked fitting (especially when there was a captain's hat) on a modern, motorized sailboat goes towards that odd sense of humour.\n\n3.  Customer Service\n\n- Response time is fast, when he wants to be.  Sent pre-sailing emails quickly, the post-sail feedback request was sent shortly afterwards by the end of the weekend.  Never did get a response for my detailed review I sent, though.\n- Adequate correspondence was something much left to be desired.  Harmless questions around possible ideas to make the bachelor party more memorable were interpreted as ways we wanted to clown around with disregard for everyone's fun and/or safety; followed by an ultimatum to sail by his rules (which we always intended) or \"spend time at a playground\".  I don't know why he didn't raise further ideas, like the pirate hat/sword he later introduced on his own, but it's moot with respect to the conclusion of poor communication.\n\nIn short, great potential (considering the overall proposition), poor execution, very disappointing.

We loved the drinks (I had the Your Money or Your Life and my girlfriend had the One Night in Babylon) which we both agreed were some of the better specialty cocktails that we have had in a long time. We started off with the crab and macadamia roll along with the crunchy shrimp roll which were both incredible but the best surprise of the night came when the steamed PEI mussels hit the table. YOU NEED TO ORDER THESE. They are honestly so good that I am worried my description of them will not do them justice so please just trust me and order them. For the main course I had the 8oz grass fed filet which was perfectly tender as well as the grilled salmon which was cooked to perfection. To top it off we had the lemon meringue pie and just like the mussels I am insisting that you order this when you go. Will definitely be back very soon, thank you for the great food and service!", "cool": 0, "date": "2016-02-05", "funny": 0, "review_id": "ucQIqg3XBRA-ZMLgAxZwkQ", "business_id": "Ap17p-tA4Ipzy1s35DfCfg", "stars": 5, "user_id": "no-iZcP4ayXfWwbOCCtRSA", "useful": 0}, {"text": "This location is open at the most convenient time... for management.

There were also cooking demonstrations using, of course, GARLIC, as well as live music on two stages. Here are a few of our favorites:\n\n* Sergio's Sarava's Garlic Shrimp: Sergio's really took the theme to heart and made a savory shrimp with big garlic flavor and presented it on a bed of garlic rice to boot! This one really hit the mark on celebrating garlic. Loved it!\n\n* Most interesting - Garlic Ice Cream by Mitchell's: we had to try it... everyone should try it... it actually did work! As a side note, they also had the most unbelievable caramel and salt ice cream. Just go try it, your jaw will drop.\n\n* Roasted Garlic Salsa from Blaze Gourmet (so big and flavorful - one of the best salsas out there, and it's local!)\n\n* Garlic Expressions Salad Dressing (yep, it's local too - we've been buying this for years.)\n\n* The Olive and the Grape's many Garlic Olive Oils, Cooking Oils, and spice packets. The spices they incorporate are not the basic stuff, these delightful blends are carefully scrutinized with a passion for the highest quality, healthiest ingredients from all over the world.\n\n* Whole Foods' extremely pungent, spicy garlic hummus. That says it all. Whoa.\n\nOur only criticism is that there were some who showcased their regular fare without doing something creative with garlic. We expected everything to be garlic something. Hence, Garlic Festival. One of those things that's basically implied, if you don't love garlic, then don't come. So we challenge participants next year to bring out the garlic.

I don't remember the name but it's a few doors down from Kearns and Co Hair salon (which is a GREAT salon btw.) I've done it twice there and they start to peel within 24 hours.

He took a look and saw that a bunch of my nails were pretty long, some pretty rough and he noticed my shellac. He explained a lot to me about how the shellac I got probably wasn't done properly and all that stuff 'cause it shouldn't be peeling, which is what I thought! \n\nFrom this point I ended up doing that cool gel thing (I don't even remember what THAT'S called--I'm 0-3 today -_-) he only had to add tips to two sad finger nails and matched their length to the rest of my fingernails.

Upon check out I was asked to pay for the service which I did thinking my fiance had forgotten to pay. I immediately called him after I left and he HAD paid in full and added a tip.

I've always like their food.  I can't remember a bad food experience.  After I write this review, I'll continue to go to Strip.\n\nLet me get straight to my point for this review....the Moscow Mule beverage.  I like this drink.  It's a very unique and refreshing beverage to serve.  But to my dismay last night, my Moscow Mule was not served in the traditional copper mug.  It was served in a glass.  Anybody who's probably ordered one might tell you, it's not a Moscow Mule unless it has the copper mug.  I agree with that statement absolutely!  So when the drink arrived at my table, my server politely told me that they aren't serving in copper mugs because restaurant patrons have stolen these mugs....that's shameful by the way.  I was clearly disappointed, but still accepted the drink, but at the same time told him that they should make it clear to patrons that the drink wouldn't be served in the copper mug, or it should be taken off the menu.  About 10 minutes later, I see another server walking by with a copper mug.  At that time, I stopped her and asked how it was possible I received my drink in a glass, but another patron was getting their drink in a copper mug.  I was told that it was up to the server because they've had so many thefts of the copper mugs.  This was somewhat of a laughable moment and I proceeded to ask myself and then my wife, \"Do I look like a guy that would take the copper mug?\"  \n\nSo for this reason, and to my annoyance, Strip is getting 2 stars.  By the way, I would have gladly conveyed my experience to a manager, had one stopped by to ask how my dining experience was going.

We went for a late lunch at 3pm, Saturday, when there wasn't any lineup and it was not busy. We each ordered the special. I had clam chowder, caesar salad, jumbo coconut shrimp with baked potatoe, and chocolate fudge brownie with ice cream. My friend ordered the exact same except her entree was blackened tilapia with a side of broccoli. The salads all come with all you can eat cheese biscuits. To keep our budget in check, we didn't order any cocktails or beer. Just water. Lucky for us, because after the soup and salad and a few biscuits, we couldn't eat our entrees! We each had a couple of forkfuls of our mains and were stuffed! I think it was the biscuits. So we asked the waiter who was very nice, to bring us containers to box up our entrees to go. Then he asked if we wanted to still have our dessert or to box that up too? Ha ha... we totally forgot that we had dessert coming. The chocolate chip sprinkled brownies were served hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. We ate the ice cream and had the brownies boxed up too. \n\nNow that I am home and working on my doggie bag, I think the best thing about Red is the service and the ambiance. It is a relatively comfortable downtown space that is not too pricey with pleasant wait staff who don't put pressure on you to order drinks and meal extras, if you don't want it. That and their Cheese biscuits, they were delicious.

As I did not have any valid drivers license at the time, he requested my passport (which was in the envelope) and so the Mexican standoff began. After persuading him several times that the only other valid ID that they can accept is in the package I am waiting to pickup and after offering more than enough alternative identification, he handed over the goods. That was nothing compared to today however.\n\nImagine the worst day in work ever. A complete bitch of a day. Then cycling home in the blazing heat in rush-hour traffic and THEN, at the last minute getting home and see a missed delivery on a letter.

We agreed without an issue, and said we would try to finish up fast or leave as soon as the group gets here. \n\nWe asked the waiter to split our bill. He said, they do not \"split for a party of our size\", really? 5 people? Then we asked if we could pay individually on card. Again, nope. I understand restaurants have policies, but not sure why he couldn't throw us a bone... cus you were basically kicking us out? \n\nOh and the the cherry on top was...

Well he tightened them so tight that they lost the curve and they are completely flat.  Yes I don't have any roll at the bottom of my eyes making them look unnatural.  I traveled though out the US seeking ocular surgeons (many of them lecturing all around the world writing books etc) all but 3 turned me away saying they have never seen eyes like mine before and couldn't repair what is going on. I went back to johns but he didn't offer any solution but to end our doctor patient relationship.  Not only are my lower lids almost non existing he also injected fat by fat graphing and now I am dealing with fat lumps that can not be removed, he gave me only one 5fu injection after months of my complaints and 6 weeks later he said he couldn't see it.  Well trust me it's still there along with many other lumps.  I agreed to pay him more money to have my cheeks injected with filler but i guess he must have seen my review on realself.com that's when I was notified that he and I are on different planes, and he finds it best if I seek another doctor.

After posting this none of you will think I have a half wit about me.  Perhaps your assessment of me will be accurate BUT I dare to challenge you to look beyond the surface for a deeper appreciation of the GM.  Yes the Galleria Mall is unappealing to the eye.  Yes there are some odd trinket stores and kiosks here and I have no beef with the description of some of the shady characters hanging around this quiet unpretentious mall.\n\nI grew up in Kingston and the more I think about it the more this mall reminds me of the Frontenac Mall in my hometown 30 years ago.  It had a Zellers in the same end of it's mall; it's decor was similar to the Galleria and you felt the same odd / sad feeling as I notice here.\n\nWhen we first moved into the hood 4 years ago our Realtor said the Galleria was supposed to be knocked down.  I remember thinking it couldn't happen soon enough.  Just looking at that place made me want to take a shower.  Well, time and my situation has allowed me to go beyond what I may see as unfortunate design and lack of care to being able to hold this mall in great appreciation.  \n\nHere is my case FOR the Galleria... \n\nIt has a Zellers, YAY Zellers!  I love saving on kid clothes and finding all sorts of things I forgot I needed like soap and underwear and sewing supplies.  \n\nI can go to Price Chopper, YAY Price Chopper!  I used to think PC was so skid.  With a tight budget now-a-days I forced myself to shop there (sometimes).  You want to know what the difference is?  Less brands to choose from.  Big deal, I can save $20 - $40 per shop, I can get down with that!  \n\nA pharmacy - like the time my son was 2 years old, I was very pregers and had to walk to a pharmacy that would likely have the electrolyte for kids so he could gain strength after puking all nite - GM's Pharmaplus had it!  We didn't have a car then so I had to walk in the blowing cold snow.  It was a life saver.  \n\nDid I mention the post office?  Did you know as big and popular as the Duff is there is no post office!?  \n\nAnd where else can I go in my neighborhood for a TD Bank?  No where else I tell you.  \n\nWhen the Dufferin Mall's S&H Health Food store was often out of the crucial herbs I needed to produce milk for my daughter's first year of life, GM's supplement store ALWAYS had it.  Need I go on?  Oh yeah and the liquor store and pet store are there too.  \n\nMy only concern with the GM is feeling a little out of place and more likely to get unwanted attention by the crowd that generally hangs around this place.  Nothing bad just stares at my red boots and glances cast from guys hanging around in the evening when I am walking alone with my Zellers scores to the car in the parking lot.\n\nIn conclusion if you fancy yourself a deeper person than someone who needs surface pleasures to complete their existence I say give this place another chance.

Yes, absolutely. \n\nI went with the gluten free gourmet white pizza (olive oil and garlic base with sun dried tomatoes, provolone, mozzarella, feta, tomatoes and onions) for kicks I added bacon.  When I opened the box it looked ok, but the smell made my mouth water!  I could barely wait to get it on a plate.  At first I was not sure about the crust, but it was REALLY good!

We had a reservation for three at 7PM on a Thursday. (Be prepared to call numerous times to get a reservation). Our waitress was courteous, prompt, and had tons of recommendations. We asked many questions about the sake and started with the monthly sake sampler. We liked some of the sake better than others, so she made us a different sampler based on our preferences. That's service! The food was a little slow coming out at the beginning, but we had tons of sake to drink, so we were happy. After we started getting dishes, service was steady.\n\nThe strip mall exterior is ugly, but the interior is elegantly understated. The bathroom also has one of those Japanese toilets with tons of features, although I didn't try any of them. \n\nThere are little touches that really make the experience special. One very cool feature is that the chopsticks are sitting on the used charcoal pieces from the grill. We were debating what they were for most of the night, so this was a fun surprise. There are also some interesting condiments on the side. They offer a green tea salt, a soy sauce, a chili powder, and a chili oil. I'm sure someone's posted a pic of them in the 400+ pics of Raku on Yelp.\n\nIn terms of the food, we liked the chicken wing, Kobe beef outside skirt with garlic, enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon, fried homemade tofu in hot broth, pork belly (nightly special), and hirame (nightly special). The tofu in hot broth is amazing, and I loved the broth and fish eggs popping in my mouth. The 2 specials, the pork belly and hirame, were both really good. The hirame came with a yuzu dipping sauce and the fish's liver, which was a surprise. The fish does take a while to prep though.\n\nWe also tried the Kurobuta pork cheek, Raku's tofu, tsukune-grilled ground chicken, and green hot chili pepper, which we didn't like as much, but were definitely not bad either. With the tsukune, I've figured out that I don't really like shiso, so that's why it wasn't one of my favorites. \n\nUnfortunately, they were out of of the chicken breast wrapped with chicken skin and the potato with corn when we were there.

Shortly after my review a response was posted asking me to contact them. I am not one to chase people down and my work day is incredibly busy. \nHowever, I made a couple of attempts to contact him over the first week, but he was always \"out\" or \"unavailable\". So I put my concerns in an email and sent that to him. I resent that same email 6 more times over the past 4 months, even as recently as 1 week ago. Still no response.\n\nLast Thursday I filed a complaint against this dealership for it's poor customer service and lack of any response to my complaint against them. GM told me I would receive a response from one of their customer experience managers in 24 to 48 hours. No response after 7 days,\n\n8:30 this morning. I got a call from Lonny. He told me he was contacted by GM and that he understood I needed to schedule service because I had an airbag light on and something with my brakes. His exact words. I told him if that was what he got from my complaint, then he needs to start over and I hung up the phone. I was insulted. After all this time someone actually thought I filed a complaint with GM because I needed to schedule service. There is a serious communication breakdown here and Lonny had no clue at that point who I was or that I had contacted him so many times previously or more importantly he never addressed my complaint from May!\n\nI called GM right after that and gave them a piece of my mind. They are supposedly straightening this out and my complaint should be addressed. After all the time that has passed, you would think that at least one person that I have contacted would care. GM continually apologized and told me they would address my complaint in less than 48 hours and they failed too.\n\nI have a right to have my vehicle serviced at the most convenient location to me. I deserve to be treated fairly, with respect and I expect and deserve to pay a fair price. Freeway and GM have failed me in all aspects in this area.\n\nI am in the valley working on a project and while I am out of my hometown, I deserve the same HIGH quality of service that I get at my local Chevy dealership. I would even settle for mediocre, but I will not be disrespected anywhere. I am still going to be here for a while and I need maintenance service now and I will need it again in the future.

She always raved about what a good job they do compared to other spas shes been to and how you get your moneys worth. So finally I decided to give it a try. We both walked in at approx 6:30 pm, had a short wait as there were only 2 workers. \n\nThe spa is quite small and is located upstairs. Don't expect anything lavish. To the front was their desk and the left was two chairs and a table. Then to the left bordered off was a few lazy boy chairs for pedicures etc.  I had a chance to enjoy some tea while I waited. They have daily deals posted on their door (back, neck and shoulder massage for $65/ 60 min- reg: $79)\n\n\nWe were greeted and told the first worker we wanted a back cleansing twice (because she barely understood or spoke english). We then had to show her the pamphlet which she looked at for the next 10 secs. Then i believe she left to prepare the room. THe second worker asked us what service we were getting and we also had to repeat ourselves twice and show it to her on the pamphlet. My gf said this never happened before. Anyhow the workers were very polite. \n\n\nThe back cleansing started with a massage and I remember thinking to myself this massage is pretty long considering I asked for back cleansing. Plus she's doing a decent job with the pressure and that it wasn't just a back rub.  \" what a good deal\"  But it just dragged and I finally asked when she was going to do the cleansing and that's when the worker said it was just aromatherapy and a massage and a hot towel. My gf told them shes had it done many times and this was not the service we had asked for. The worker apologized, told us to get dressed and called the manager. We don't know the names of the workers because they never introduced themselves, but  in the end they told us they are both new and apologized. WHAT KIND OF SPA SCHEDULES TWO NEW PERSON TO WORK AT THE SAME TIME WITH NO RESOURCE? We got charged a total of $62 (discounted price) for the service that we didn't ask for and they gave us a card to save $20 for two persons on our next return for a facial or massage. \n\nREALLY? $20 for two persons to return? and we got charged?? c'mon! \nMy gf hated her massage saying it was below avg.

My boyfriend, who is somewhat picky at what restaurant to eat at, was happily  surprised and enjoyed our experience.  \n\nThe restaurant is very clean, and inviting.  The staff was very friendly.  It wasn't that busy at 430pm but at about 6 pm'ish people started to come in.  We started off with 3 empanadas (beef, chicken and spinach).  We both agreed that the beef and chicken was very good.  Spinach was good, to me. My boyfriend doesn't like spinach too much, anyway.  We also ordered the Ensalada del Chef.  It's very large - I think it can feed 4 people with nice portions on each plate.  It had everything on it:  deli meats, peperocinos,  slices of hard boiled eggs, julienne slices of carrots, slices of olives, thin slices of red onions....etc etc.   And, was very good.  The dressing they give is is just a light balsamic and olive oil that you mix yourself.  Not sure if they have other flavored dressings but then, we didn't ask.  We were okay to just use what was given to us.  \n\nFor entree, I had the Mariscos Buenes Aires and I enjoyed it.  The red wine sauce was savory and sweet.  There was squid in the recipe and gladly it was very tender and not chewy.  My boyfriend ordered the Salmon Grillado.  He enjoyed it.  I tasted a bite of the salmon and also the parmesan potatoe side that came with it.  It was yum.  The salmon was a good long piece of fillet.  Nothing special about the salmon, though. No special seasonings or anything.  I can make it better at home but it is a nice serving of a fish.  Add the chimichurri sauce and it enhanced the flavor!!  :)\n\nFor dessert I ordered the Flan, waitress recommended, and, my boyfriend ordered the Panquesques dulce de leche (which we took to go).  I am glad we did because the Flan was a big serving!  I had flan before but this recipe was outstanding!  It was served with a side of whip cream and 3 dollops of carmel.  OMG!   YUM YUM YUM!!  I wanted to take a pic of it but both of our phones were in the car.  I liked that presentation of it.  :)  Can't tell you yet on the Panquesques - we are relaxing from the dinner still.  :)\n\nAND, lastly but not forgotten - the chimichurri sauce was awesome!   You could put this sauce on anything and it would be great.  My boyfriend put some of it on his salmon and it was yummy!   Soooo gooood!!!  For drinks I had the Inka Cola - cool and refreshing.  It is sweet like a vanilla root beer like taste but yellow in color. :)))  My boyfriend ordered a Heineken at first and his second beer he took the suggestion of the waitress and ordered the Quilmes.  He said the Quilmes was very tasty.  \n\nThey have a deli section filled with meats, desserts, sauces, sandwiches and also a store towards the back where you can buy the chimichurri sauce, Argentinian wine, candy, flour, dulce de leche sauce, carmel sauce,  etc etc.   It was a nice set-up.\n\nMy family is visiting in 3 weeks, I would definately take them here.

But let me explain why I feel the need to write a love letter on yelp at 2 in the morning and why you should still care especially since you never worked there.  \nFOOD:\nIt's simple and delicious.  This is the 10 dollar burger that you wish you would have bought 2 of just to take 1 home.  At least 8 different cheeses to choose from, or do the combo 4 cheeses, add grilled onion, lettuce, tomato, and maybe some Nueske's bacon (ask for it extra crispy).  BLAMMO.  You will try to replicate it at home but it will never work. It is the best burger I've ever had and I was born and raised in Nebraska.\nAnd it's not just the burgers, the chicken sandwiches, the salads and the apps are all great.  And keep in mind I've seen all of this made, It's not that it's just great food, it's that it's all done in an impeccably clean kitchen with a great cooks that care about what they're doing. I have never seen such a consistent kitchen staff as I have at AZ, come in at 7 pm or call in an order at 12:29am and the food will always be good.\nBAR:\nHoly Moly I don't even know where to start.  I've been in this industry for 15 years and I've never seen a bar staff put out such a quality product in such a small amount of time.  AZ has the most delicious drinks that for the most part are all concocted in pint glasses, shaken and poured into rather large martini glasses with ingredients that include, but are not limited to; fresh cucumber and mint, hand squeezed juices, fresh sweet and sour, orange juice ice cubes, cherries that aren't soaked in formaldehyde, and an arrange of spirits so broad that first time patrons usually walk in with their mouths agape.  But what would booze be without someone to serve it to you? Sit at the bar and get to know your tender; good stories, great cocktails, and handsome men in ties.\nWAITSTAFF:\nAgain I know I'm biased, but this is one hell of a waitstaff.  Be it gluten free, dairy free, or basically any allergy, and this staff can handle the order.  They know all of the ingredients and are able to special prep things for you even on the busiest of Saturday nights.  The best part is they will make it look easy (I clocked 6 miles on my pedometer 1 Saturday night). \nWhen it comes to attitude don't be fazed by the \"Scottsdale idea\" of AZ.  I have never met a more down to earth group of people in my life.  They will remember you, what table you like to sit at, the Malbec you like with your burger and the name of that song you want the DJ to play.  Again, get to know your server, they will surprise you.\nAMBIANCE:\nThis review is already way too long so I will just say that the surroundings are ever changing, and it's kind of like an really cool modern art museum that you can eat and drink in and spill on the floor and nobody will yell at you but who cares because you  wouldn't hear anyway because the music is the jams. But it is sooo beautiful; park, trees, statues, giant patio lights, glass house, crazy xmas trees, etc. etc. etc.\nSHOUTOUT:\nAlso, let me just say, that none of this would be possible without an amazing owner that cares about his patrons just as much as his staff.  Which, in turn, provides a great and caring management.  And then becomes a solid team of people that actually give a shit.\nTo the best crew I've ever worked with.

Needless to say based on reviews we have read, he's broken numerous things and never compensated for them. \n\nHe quickly came to our house (almost too quickly) to give us a quote and asked for a E-Interact transfer for a deposit of $250. We didn't hesitate and left our guard down because it was a referral. I also asked for boxes and he mentioned he got a deal. In total we gave him $370 for the deposit and boxes. In hindsight this was a small price to pay - based on other reviews, had he never show up, then it would have cost a lot more (or impossible) to find a replacement. \n\nWe had to quickly determine a Plan B. We messaged Todd every day, multiple times a day to \"5 minute\" then \"7 minutes\" to an \"hour\"... to \"on my way!\"\n\nHe never messaged and when he did, he said he his aunt needed to go to the calgary hospital from Banff (as if there no hospital there), that he got caught up in a bad move, that he was going to come over that evening but never did, the excuses kept layering on.  \n\nNeedless to say, my husband tried to reason with him and then Todd tried pawning our contact over to his \"assistant\" who then said he should expect a credit that never came. Likely it's a family scam where they try to buy as much time as possible. First of all, he made us provide the deposit to \"save the date\" through e-interac when he said his \"Square\" swipe was in the car. When I spoke to my other friend who was referred to him, she also paid the deposit through Einterac which shows he's overall SHADY! He mentioned he \"forgot\" his square in the car. DONT BELIEVE HIM. \n\nHe's good at messaging to get the initial deposit then will never be available. I'm sorry to say, but find someone more expensive but worth it. This guy is a JOKE (at minimum). \n\nNow we are looking to settle this within small claims court. \n\nBe smart and don't be like me: NEVER book this guy. Save yourself lots of money and time.

No.. we tried eating a couple pieces with soy sauce and it did not taste good at all. We just couldn't eat it, so I called back asking if they could give us a refund for the screaming o instead of the discount for next time. We'd be willing to drive all the way back and bring the fish because it's such a waste of $16 when we only ate a couple pieces of it.

We waste $16 today and they want us to come back again to spend another $16 just to get $1.60 discount. Really? That is just ridiculous. I work at a restaurant and it's really not that hard to void a payment. Or if this restaurant really doesn't know how to void payments, they could always give the refund back in cash.

Of course I just got voicemail and 2 days later no one called back.  I called my credit card company and they responded immediately and took care of it for me!  In October we got hit with their new \"low balance fee\" for anyone who doesn't have credit cards or loans with Riverset - no letter of warning or email 30 days before like banks always do.  We have over $2000 a month in direct deposit, and we get punished with a $7 a month fee for \"low balance\"???  This is outrageous for a credit union.  This is something to be expected from a bank - and we have accounts with other major banks and they always forewarn.  That's supposed to be the selling point with a credit union - free checking.  \nAnd last week I attempted to renew my AVG antivirus and once again Riverset blocked it because it came from the Netherlands, the 3rd year in a row, despite emailing them last year to unblock it.  This time I got the usual robocall from their security and called their automated line, no human of course.  I clicked \"1\" to indicate yes, I did authorize it.  And a few days ago AVG informed me it was denied!! There was more than enough money to pay it.  What part of \"yes I authorized this transaction\" is difficult to comprehend?  I got on live chat with AVG and had to use my Citizens debit card, and it was paid within seconds!  I shouldn't have to get permission to authorize automatic debits with my own money as long as the money's there in my account.\nAs for their e-statements?  They're a jumbled mess, with no beginning and ending balance, all thrown together.  My 14-year-old could do a better job.\nWith the punitive \"low balance\" fee, we are in process of getting out.

We drove down to the office to turn in our application in person, on a wednesday afternoon at 4. The place was a ghost town. We tried calling the office, and knocked on the office door and no one was there. They do not have business hours posted on their building or website, and were under the assumption, from our experience with other realty companies, that they would be open until 5 pm. We called our realtor and he was puzzled as to why they would not be there. He got a hold of the lady that runs Shannon Day and she told him that their hours are 9am to 3pm Monday -Friday!!   I do not understand how one expects to have a successful business when your hours are 9am to 3pm.\nCome to find out that she is the only one who runs the place and is almost impossible to get a hold of. Our application was accepted, although it took almost a week to get an answer back, we also have no idea the name of the owner or where he is located.\nWe loved the property, and decided to give it a shot and move in. We gave them our deposit (which included a $250 cleaning deposit, and they stated that they were going to bring in a cleaning service to do some basic carpet cleaning and wipe down of walls, toilets, etc.)\nCome moving day once we got really close to the walls and got up close and personal with the house we discovered that the walls were filthy, even the ceilings seemed to have some sort of browish yellow splatter on them, even in the bathrooms! The kitchen was the worst. The vent above the stove had old caked on yellow grease which took forever to get off and the tops of the vaulted ceilings in the kitchen (which are almost impossible to reach, just by the way they were designed) had red spaghetti like sauce splatter on them. The walls were dirty and looked like they hadnt been cleaned in a long time, the showers had black mold in them and they had obviously not been cleaned. The only thing that had appeared to be cleaned were the toilets.\nThe first night that were supposed to be moving our stuff in was spent in hours of scrubbing walls and cabinets, baseboards, and painting mismatched half assed paint jobs that were very visible and looked horrible. I dont even know why someone would bother in painting a patch on a wall that does not match at all.\nWhen we ran our vacuum cleaner throughout the house for the first time and our entire canister in the vacuum was filled with fur and dirt, like it hadnt been vaccumed in a long time, and my husband also cleaned the carpets and the water that was being sucked up in the machine was pitch black. It was very obvious that the place had not been cleaned. Most of our money so far has been put into cleaning and painting pure neglect and stupidity. We take pride in our home and dont settle for our home looking dirty with mismatching paint. We contacted Shannon Day so they could send a repairman out to fix the oven (the oven would not ignite and cook food) and that took 2 weeks, the only time that they responded right away was for a plumbing issue. We have only been in the home for a few months and over the last month a few drawers in the kitchen broke because the design of the home builders was to STAPLE the drawer tracks in. My husband had to fix that by hand and secure it to ensure it wouldnt break on us again, but whos to say that others wont break and thats something that Shannon Day isnt going to have someone come and fix. Overall the home is older, but if it was cared for properly by previous tenants then we would not be having these issues, which is frustrating that things are slowly failing on us. Overall, so far, i'm not very happy with Shannon Day.\nOne Good thing out of this is that we have really nice neighbors next to and across from us.\n\nI'm nervous to see how we will be treated come the day that we move out.\nOnly time will tell, but I wont be surprised if it all goes sour.\n\nWhen it comes to doing business with this company....you have been warned.", "cool": 0, "date": "2013-10-28", "funny": 0, "review_id": "Ehcfalu7UDzZ78WqpiucTA", "business_id": "wo2BIf1R3nus3yx8DjtakQ", "stars": 1, "user_id": "ruVwLL_rWv_s4d0ANPttPw", "useful": 7}, {"text": "I have been here a few times. \n\nEach time I went the food was actually really good, so I decided to order catering, being that the food was really good and the service was good the last few times I went.\n\nApparently the service changed, and this is where they lose me as a customer.\n\nA few days ago I tried to order catering from this company for a small party.\n\nMy husband had gone into the restaurant 2 days prior to me ordering, just to check out the catering prices.

At an Italian spot it might be Pizza Margherita or Veal Parmigiana, For French food it might be Moules Frites or the Torchon of Foie Gras.  It's the dish that, if prepared properly, signals that the cuisine is up to par.  When trying to ascertain whether the full range of offerings is worth exploring it must first be determined that the kitchen can get the basics right.\n\nMy benchmark dish for any Thai restaurant is Tom Kha Kai, a magical combination of chicken, chicken broth, coconut cream, galanga, fish sauce, mushrooms, lime juice, and chili oil.  Ingredients may vary from spot to spot, as they often will, but the overall composition is pretty consistent.  The rub, as I have experienced it, is in getting the balance right.  Some places have too much coconut cream, others offer just a hint of chili oil (or omit it completely.)  I've had it with all kinds of mushrooms, and sometimes with huge chunks of galanga, and sometimes with none at all.  For one as obsessed as I, it grows a little tiresome.\n\nI have had Tom Kha Kai at countless restaurants in the Southland, and am still looking for one that is as perfectly put together as what they serve at Lotus of Siam, the celebrated industrial park oddity way off the strip in Las Vegas.  Everything is in perfect balance and when I that first spoonful slides down my gullet I almost tear up a little.  Seriously.  It's just that feeling one encounters when something is SO right.. there's a magic to it.\n\nThe rest of the menu can be a little hit-or-miss, as others have noted.  But there is so much on the menu that is off-the-charts terrific that it hardly seems to merit de-starring.\n\nSo five stars for the crispy duck with spicy mint leaves.  Five stars for the Nam Kao Todd, crispy rice with minced sour sausage.  Five stars for the spicy beef salad.  So what if the Panag curry is a little lifeless?  There is certainly no shortage of items on this menu that make my head spin with delight.\n\nAnd no, the decor is nothing to write home about.  I couldn't care less because the service is always so friendly and accommodating.  My blinders go on at Lotus and when I have an array of tasty treats in front of me I can't even SEE the decor.  Love really is blind, I guess.\n\nAnd eleventy-billion stars for the wine list.  Jeez LOUISE the wine list.  Nothing, NOTHING goes better with spicy Thai cuisine than a cold bottle of Reisling and Lotus of Siam has scads of them.  Rare and highly rated selections at rock-bottom prices.  Donhoff.  J.J. Prum.  Zind-Humbrecht.  All the heavy hitters are represented, and there are plenty of Goldkapsels at near-release prices. Achtung! A perfect match for every dish can be found here along with a staff that can guide you through the polysyllabic minefield that one encounters with all things Germanic.\n\nStay away from the buffet.  Make a point of ordering some Northern dishes.  ABSOLUTELY order a bowl of the Tom Kha.  When visiting at night be sure to make a reservation and DEFINITELY arrange with your cab driver to pick you up after your meal because the parking lot gets a little bit sketchy after dark.  But for me, no trip to Vegas is complete without a visit to Lotus.

She hated going to the vet office so I couldn't bare the thought of bringing her to an animal hospital to take her last breath. \nDr Veena rushed over to my house with genuine concern for Shelby. She was so soft spoken and so  kind to Shelby. I decided to have dr Veena put her to sleep outside, on her bed, in the grass by the garden of flowers and trees. she was always so happy sun bathing. As I spoke to Shelby and made her feel at ease, dr veena administered the sedative. Dr veena made me feel comfortable that my baby was in good hands. The procedure was painless and dr veena took a paw print for me to keep and then took Shelby's physical body away. I know Shelby's spirit went to heaven and am at peace at the way she left this world. \nDr veena recommended a book for me to read to help ease my sadness. later that week she sent me the most beautiful card with such kind words that made my heart smile. \nI couldn't imagine anyone else taking Shelby away to a better place.

New menu, that looked way fancier than the atmosphere of the place could support.  I was skeptical, but the chef has done a fine job. \n\nI had the chicken club.

I was surprised by the less than average wait time. However, it quickly became clear as to the reason. The mousy intake nurse could not be bothered with conversation and appeared to be inconvenienced by my presence. The Nurse Practioner (NP) came to the exam room to  address my complaint. She spoke so quickly that I didn't catch her name. There were no notes in front of her from my intake or records about my health history for her to reference. I complained of acute pain and was sent to xray without any physical evaluation. After the xrays were read she returned only to tell me to go to my Primary Care Provider. (I'm at UC for a reason). Upon intake I mentioned that I've been taking Aleve for a month and that it's no longer effective and causing stomach problems. The NP stated that she would give me a steroid which would work for the pain. I left expecting to begin feeling relief from the script provided. Wrong. Come to find out, the steroid will take approximately two days to start relieving inflammation. As mentioned, I went to UC for a reason. I was still in pain and wanted to consult the NP further to determine what I could take considering my stomach issues (note that I was asking about OTC meds, not narcotics.) I contacted the number listed only to find out that you can't speak directly with the clinic. I waited for a call back which to my dismay was not from the NP, but the intake nurse. The nurse told me to continue to take Aleve. I reiterated my stomach issues and like a robot she repeated the information and assured me that's what the NP suggested. Hoping to speak with an individual that would answer my question I called back.  As mentioned, you can't speak with the clinic directly. Customer Service offered two solutions. 1. I can leave a voice mail with my complaints and if \"they\" find a problem they will call me back. 2. I would need to make a copay to see a different doctor. Once I  visited my PCP she was astonished that the NP would suggest Aleve despite stomach issues as they counteract. I have never been treated so poorly by someone practicing medicine. I can't stress enough the lack of empathy and concern during my visit and in speaking with Customer Service.", "cool": 0, "date": "2016-01-29", "funny": 0, "review_id": "isJhLTrN9BKn0Au4ujtngA", "business_id": "o9-ZRUwmM26zTDpAx_xL0Q", "stars": 1, "user_id": "Z6MZYF6zF9TcFaJQRpJA-A", "useful": 2}, {"text": "Love chilis,I think it's better than applebees.

They have been around since last winter but until a few days ago I had never heard of it. Too bad for me because I have been missing out!. \n\nMy wife and I just decided to order a bit of this and that (which I think is the point of the menu). We ordered mac n cheese, garden salad, fontina sticks and chicken and waffles. the food came out in a timely manner and  sort of created its own tempo where we always had a new dish in front of us but never had two at any one time. \n\nThe fried fontina was the first and the most disappointing of the four. There was a nice light breadcrumb coating over the super soft mild cheese. There was a lack of seasoning/salt in this dish. They were served with a yin and yang of sauces, pear and red pepper. The pear sauce was very good but the red pepper sauce really needed something else. The dish was a great concept (who doesn't like fired cheese) but needed some more seasoning or tweaking.\n\nThe second dish was the salad, tons of spinach, frisee, pickled shallots, green grapes, salami, goat cheese balls. VERY GOOD SALAD, just would have liked the salametti cut into thinner or smaller pieces. \n\nThe third dish was the Mac n Cheese w/o the optional lobster. In my persuit for the perfect Mac n Cheese this ranked very high. A perfect combo of cheeses and breadcrumbs and noodles. Then the kicker was that they fried up some proscuitto and crumbled on top. MMMMM good.\n\nThe fried chicken with white cheddar waffles was next.... The chicken looked so dark when it arrived that I thought I was going to have to send it back BUT when I tasted the fried batter it was really nice. Good seasoning and nice crunch. The chicken was moist and very good. I did not get the citrus brine flavor the menu talked about but still very good. The cheddar waffles were supper good and almost gooey. The greens they served with them were shocking but good. Acidic and spicy but not chewy as braised greens often get. The combo of the three sets of flavors worked very well. We opted out of dessert but will go back next time for the upside down pineapple cake or the chocolate mousse with fresh whipped cream.\n\nI would have to say that this is one of my favorite spaces in phoenix. I found out that the owner is an architect and then it made more sense. One great big area with slightly mismatched tables and chairs. Simple table settings with white butcher paper. Mint sprigs instead of flowers, simple candles, etc... There was a great little lounge area with couches and coffee tables where a couple ate and looked very intellectual. The lighting was soft but well placed and lots of windows with the summer evening light shining in. The music was a great mix of mostly stuff I had never heard but still found myself wondering who it was so I could download it on itunes the minute I got home.Kudos  to the creator of that playlist, so refreshing from the common restaurant music these days. I am sure the very clean open kitchen would add some energy to the room had they been slammin but the three cooks looked rather board. The only negative I would say about the dining  room was the TV at the bar. I don't mind a TV at a bar (actually I think it is crucial) but I just wish the TV would have been facing a different direction or mounted on the north wall so that it didn't interfere with the vibe so much.\n\nOverall... could be one of my new go-to spots!!!

My hubby & I are hesitant to stay there because of some bad/mixed reviews both from Yelpers/Tripadvisor commentaries.  But after reading more recent reviews, I told my hubby to give it a try since I always try not to be too critical when reviewing new establishments -particularly this large--give them time to get their act together, pull the right staff, iron out kinks at least for 6-12 months.\n\nThe registration area was not dark-it's modern - different shades of gray stones, tiles and textures, wood--for this type of decor, I can understand why you do not really need very bright lights--it is part of the whole ambience--maybe that's not for all-hence, some patrons were critical of it...hey..ladies...this type of lighting is actually good for any skin tones--good for your close-ups!\n\nWe stayed there 9/8/10 & checked out Sunday. We were both pleasantly surprised - we did not experience long waiting to check in, friendly & helpful staff, room was pretty large-and it was just their standard - marble travertine bath floor, deep soaking tub, water pressure good in the shower and it was not hard at all to manipulate the automatic/remote control (on the walls) for the curtains, lights-it's very intuitive and noted clearly on the wall switches. When we checked in, we also asked if we can have a view & the rep changed our room--we had a corner view right by Monte Carlo/MGM side--it was very nice especially at night with all the lights.\n\nWe also received $200 free play--as soon as we checked in, we went down to the Player's club & obtain our Player cards..and activated our free play--guess what--I went to the dollar machine and I was winning up to $650 & then...I hit the 3 diamonds (showed up in 3 different lines-if all are in the same line..it would have been the bigger jackpot) and won the jackpot of $1200! Attendant came & gave me cash--but I did have to give my SSN--IRS jackpot report for every $1200 you win! But it was a great start...their machines appear to have a better percentage in winning more as compared to other casinos (I guess to get more patrons). Hubby played black jack tables..broke even...and later won $1500 at the Venetian! Need to mention that they also gave us $100 food or beverage credit and a free pass (so you do not line up for two of their restaurants). We never got to use the $100/food/beverage but they comped the two breakfast services we had when we checked out--nice!\n\nFriday & Saturday morning, we ordered American breakfast & it arrived in less than 30 minutes! It was decent - nothing too exciting...but at least the service was very good. Our room was cleaned each day and extra towels even if we told the cleaners..we have enough.\n\nThey have 2 other buildings under contruction, in progress. But the ones that are totally completed looked very nice - those are for sale - as condos/loft. I'm sure the prices are great right now because of the drastic downswing in the real estate there and the overall economy. You can tell that Vegas is not doing great right now--not crowded Thursday night, Friday night--unusual compared to past years when day/night, you can't even walk or drive on the main strip.We always fly and just take the cab instead of walking to other casinos --unless of course it it's right next to where we're staying.\n\nOne complaint: The high-end shops called Crystals--Aria should open up from the casino level to get there instead of patrons having to step out --even though it's right next. They need to put more signs that Crystals is the mall--you would not have known. There are 4 or 5 good restaurants inside --but the mall's pretty empty--I hope Aria will advertise this one and like I said, provide an opening via the casino.\nThe patisserie Jean Philippe was wonderful --almost as good as those in Paris! It's not cheap...but you're in Vegas ..splurge a little!\n\nWe will definitely go back to this place again - I'm sure with all the comments, they will hopefully listen and improve in different areas.", "cool": 0, "date": "2010-09-18", "funny": 0, "review_id": "9dRN2EUrxrDf6VyUNLEUcw", "business_id": "SMPbvZLSMMb7KU76YNYMGg", "stars": 4, "user_id": "bhd4hC20Cu2lbXjlGYMK8g", "useful": 1}, {"text": "Excellent haircut.

The Wednesday had a fairly respectable crowd while the Friday was pretty packed.  Wednesday had people mostly eating.  Friday had lots of people drinking, being seen, and eating.   The mall it's in was pretty quiet at night so these people walked away from the casino just to come here.  Must be pretty popular in Vegas right now, eh?\n\nAnyway, service was fine for such a packed place.  We had a table on the curving banquette which places you pretty damn close to whoever's got the table next to you.  (People were moving tables in order to get in or out).  The table's small so it's a good thing this place seems to focus on a lot of small plates that come out at odd times.  Drinks came regularly and food came at a reasonable wait.  \n\nWe had the Wagyu ishiyaki (hot rock cooking at your table) which was sort of fun because with such a small table I imagine you might end up cooking your neighbor's elbow.  Wagyu robatayaki, eggplant robatayaki, tempura green beans, eel avocado hand roll, some kind of fries that were really sauced baby potatoes, and a bunch of drinks.  I loved the nina fresa, by the way.  Strawberry martini.  Everything was good.  The ishiyaki was more tasty/fun than the robatayaki, if you want wagyu.\n\nThey took pretty good care of us on the Friday when we told them it was our anniversary.  Free dessert.

When the lady finished, it came out dark brown base and CHUNKY YELLOW (and when i say yellow..i mean the YELLOW LIKE THE SUN) HIGHLIGHTS. I stared at the mirror and almost was going to tear and when the I complained..she told me that she can fix it, but she had to charge a lot more. It was already expensive, so she said to save me money, she wouldn't dry my hair...so I walked out with a crappy haircut & color and wet hair...*sigh*\n\n\nAnyways, since I read so many good reviews, I decided to give Parlour a try. \n\n*Finding park was hard because it is street parking...i should have went by bus...\n\ni booked my haircut with Brionie...she was very sweet. I told her that I don't really style my hair and i wanted something easy to maintain and she listened to what i wanted. and started getting to work...first she flat ironed my hair, then stared cutting. I got to say...I felt very relax in the chair (i actually almost dozed off, haha) I ended up loving the haircut. She didn't cut it too short and she gave me exactly what I wanted, which was long layers..no choppy layers(YAY!)\n\nAfter that, it was on to color...\n\nMarkis was great. I told him I wanted to dye my hair one color...just to change it up...and I told him i wanted his opinion which shade of brown i should go for and he chose the perfect shade! \n\nOverall, I'm for sure coming back here.

Was given a two massage \"gift\" for my wife and I through Living Social. Called to make an appointment and the desk lady gave us the \"you can't use it for two people. Didn't you read the fine print?\" runaround. I contacted the person who gave us the coupon and they decided to give us another so we could both go, so I called back to schedule an appointment. They couldn't do it on a few days that we could because they were \"remodeling.\" I explained that my wife and I live overseas and only had a week and a half to get both massages. The desk lady promised me she would get us in twice before we leave, but refused to schedule the second ahead of time. She said they can't do that until the first appointment, but again PROMISED she would get us in both times before we leave... more on that later.\n\nWe arrived to the place in shambles and obviously in the middle of being remodeled (why were they even open?). Holes in the drywall being patched and scraped down, paint cans laying around, the whole nine yards. The lady at the desk had her back turned to us and barely looked up to greet us when we walked in. We filled out the paperwork and noticed right away that one if not two of the workers were obviously under the influence. Not a great first impression.\n\nBoth ladies who gave us the massage were friendly and the massage itself was good. Though it was a bit uncomfortable in the tiny room with the smell of alcohol and the cramped quarters. The room smelled like strong alcohol every time one of the ladies breathed. Not an ideal environment for a massage. I had asked when I made the reservation for my wife and I to be in the same room for the massage, so they stuffed us in a room the size of a walk in closet. The ladies could barely move around the tables and kept knocking things over throughout the 90 mins. Again, I want to stress, the massage was great, I just couldn't be more unimpressed with the overall experience. We got dressed and walked out to schedule the second time and SURPRISE... they were all booked up. I threw out all the dates and times that we could before we left the country to go back home, but all we're taken for \"paying customers and clients\" (does a coupon not count as a paying customer?). She passive aggressively suggested we should have come in sooner, even though I explained we weren't even in the same state. There were obviously huge gaps on the calendar open on her computer screen, but she assured me they were all booked until the day after we left. Convenient.\n\nThe desk lady then explained that I could just give the coupon to someone else (something she had already told me on the phone we could not do), so after being lied to the first time I asked her to write it on the coupons. She only wrote it on one and I had to ask her to wrote it on both. I'm pretty sure she will still try to argue about it with the poor souls who we may or may not give these coupon to.\n\nThe cherry on the cake was that after being lied to and offered no practical help to get us our second massage; I was chased out into the parking lot by the desk lady asking for a tip. I explained that I don't tip for the level of service and unprofessionalism we experienced (mostly her fault). Never done that in my life. She gave me a guilt trip about how the ladies were on commission and also passive aggressively indicated that I was unaware of the cultural norms in America. Ha! I'm pretty sure being drunk on the job is not up to cultural norms in America either. I explained that I would not tip for that kind of service and for being treated as a second class customer to their \"paying\" clients.\n\nThis is the first negative review I've ever posted on yelp and probably a waste of time. But I wrote it because the level of customer service from the desk lady WAS REALLY THAT BAD! I left asking the question, why offer a coupon on LivingSocial if you're going to treat those paying customers like garbage?

The Paul Gebhard agency branch is terrible", "cool": 1, "date": "2015-09-21", "funny": 0, "review_id": "KbJJeA7C-O7Ixw3P7aqybA", "business_id": "T_KGxMC9BKYv6qyATdTvgQ", "stars": 1, "user_id": "1KrRj3I2xl19n57qcJzYqA", "useful": 0}, {"text": "Update: After receiving a response here from the GM, I called Planet Hyundai for a resolution.  I did not speak to the GM, but rather to a woman named, Eva, I believe, who probably deals with all customer service issues.  She was very friendly, but unfortunately, all that was offered to me were a couple free oil changes(!)  I reiterated the situation, and advised her that I had to shell out more than five hundred dollars to fix the issues, after their service people stated everything was okay.  I also mentioned that I live about 15 miles away, so why would I want to drive all the way there to get a free oil change, which are a dime a dozen?  I feel like Planet Hyundai should have at least offered to take care of either the parts or labor portion of what I had to spend elsewhere, as all of these issues happened within two weeks of buying the car AND after their mechanics assured me that all was okay.  Thanks for the gesture of a couple of free oil changes, but that was a little insulting.  And, I know how the chain of command works, but if I get a \"response\" from the GM, I would expect to speak to the GM.", "cool": 0, "date": "2012-10-10", "funny": 0, "review_id": "0V2kC9ljL9W02eULBKqy4Q", "business_id": "bdPJYc4dx48FcgHSBD1swA", "stars": 1, "user_id": "sMr2UQF1dP7Y2oBVdlGmgw", "useful": 2}, {"text": "I'm very pleased with Jeff & his crew.  Our crown molding job had some rounded areas where flex molding was used & a bit more challenging.  They installed perfectly.  One of the major perks for me was how they left my house when they were done.  Very clean & pictures rehung correctly. The boys forgot touch up paint on 1 wall.  Jeff came back that same week with his paint brush.  I really appreciate when a company does a job & follows up to make sure all is well.

They got sat fairly quickly, 6 tops, 4 tops and some couples and our name was called in about 10 minutes. Kevin, our waiter was very professional and kept water in our glasses the whole morning. He told us of the promotion they're having right now which I was very interested in. He recommended the cupcake pancakes I think they are called, so I agreed. Being a younger couple, he had my boyfriend and I laughing pretty much every time he checked in on us, which was often. We waited only about 10 minutes for our food and received our check without pressure so that we could go to the front and pay whenever we are ready. As very fast eaters, we usually go out for the food not the experience. Not to put down the experience of ihop, but the main reason we go is the food and service. I would recommend the stuffed French toast if you're looking for something and have a sweet tooth, and the chocolate chip pancakes are always pleasing.", "cool": 0, "date": "2016-04-29", "funny": 0, "review_id": "gOdZpIhoz81oV2T9Ls0Gkg", "business_id": "Om5mo4oWKPn_kPpLjNiV4Q", "stars": 5, "user_id": "_935SaxZ8w7CN642KwIx_g", "useful": 0}, {"text": "My immediate family has sold 3 cars to this location and my mom just bought from them.

Their appraisals take only about 20-25 minutes and they go through in detail why they priced it that way because of dents, features, and marks on the title. He wanted to make sure we got the best car for us because they are paid by car, not amount commission here, takes a lot of pressure away from having to buy more than you need or a luxury car that's too much.
