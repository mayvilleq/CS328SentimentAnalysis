Had them come and clean my girlfriends and I car on a Friday morning while I decided to work out of the house. Was very pleased with the attention to detail, cleanliness and timeliness with Serge and his team. Cheaper than most drive thru car washes and they come to you. Definitely recommend him to all your family and friends.", "business_id": "lQeeyNh8YwypuBDN1Y8Dyw", "useful": 1, "date": "2017-03-27"}, {"user_id": "0PIpUDTNJBGkB397KCMRig", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "review_id": "hGl_sCz18XSUJDL-bcatqw", "funny": 0, "text": "The pizza is fantastic, but the employees are very rude. The wait for a pizza is unbelievable at an approximate time of an hour & a half for a pizza. Still worth the wait though.", "business_id": "02E9r4BQzVrA76Bf7G-KMw", "useful": 9, "date": "2016-02-12"}]
