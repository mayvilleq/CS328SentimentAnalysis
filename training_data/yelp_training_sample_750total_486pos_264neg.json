The uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'. Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.\n\nWe spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.\n\nAfter a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon & smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.\n\nWhen the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.\n\nBetween the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.\n\nAmazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.\n\nI would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).  If you haven't been, add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner!", "date": "2012-05-02", "cool": 0, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "business_id": "d_Go5TsiFMIRtCE6XS8Sjw", "stars": 4}, {"useful": 7, "funny": 1, "review_id": "BqMTHIJ_S5aT3Mt1fWT_pg", "text": "As I'm writing this, I already know a lot of people are going to disagree with me. After all, the arrival of littlefish in the Junction has definitely been well received. The neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot. Unfortunately, the arrival of littlefish hasn't completely filled that void just yet. They still have a few kinks to work out, but don't give up on them yet. I won't, but only because I really want to love it.\n\nOk. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.\n\nThe brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.\n\nThe staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.\n\nThe thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.\n\nPeople rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.\n\nMake no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West, they may not be doing as well as they are now.\n\nSo would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.", "date": "2011-02-23", "cool": 2, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "business_id": "BmgfYQ3tpRKnT9H9WvjL_g", "stars": 3}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "s3a5WnVtA5tknXqKcKvC4w", "text": "This is a fine place to dine but nothing special.

Anyway, my fiance goes to try his shake, and low and behold...no peanut butter.  He goes to the register and just simply asks, \"Can you add peanut butter to my shake?\"  Sammy looks at the ice cream scooper who took our order and asks, \"Did he ask for peanut butter?\" ....she says no.  Seriously little girl?  We were all there, we had a discussion about not having peanut butter ice cream...how can you try and manage this lie?  So as I'm explaining to this girl to try and refresh her memory about our order...Sammy rudely interrupts and says, \"Well it's going to cost more to add peanut butter.\"  We all just looked at each other shocked and the girl who took our order stated, \"My bad.\" as if she really thought that was a proper apology.

My boyfriend is a huge buffet fan, and we both love Thai food.  He got really, really excited and I couldn't say no, so we purchased our final deal of the day, went and ran some errands, and finished off at Thai Buffet.\n\nWe were the only ones there at that time, but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch (I think we arrived around 4:15-ish).  The buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself, but it is all you can eat.  Joann, the owner, described each of the dishes to us and piled our plates high with a variety of curries, as well as a bowl of soup and another plate of salad.  We couldn't say no to any of the dishes, they all looked super amazing.  And they were.\n\nMy favorite was probably the green curry; it wasn't as spicy as some green curries and it had green beans in it, which I love.  Everything tasted more homemade than \"restaurant-y,\" for lack of a better descriptor.  I felt like I was in a Thai grandma's kitchen, and it was awesome.\n\nAs we finished our massive plates of food, Joann went back into the kitchen and prepared us bowls of coconut ice cream with mango, pumpkin custard, and sticky rice.  This might have been my favorite part of the meal, but it's hard to say because it was all so good.  I'm a total sucker for sticky rice, though.\n\nDefinitely will be back.

Something a little more creative (with same meat!) would have been lovely. I will say I really loved the beef-cheek ravioli - I stole my boyfriends because I felt my portion needed to have more in it. Personally, the wet and dry aged beef were good and \"beefy and meaty,\" but my preferences run towards melty and buttery type of steak. I preferred the dry aged to the wet...the wet aged just seemed a little bland in comparison. \n\nWe veered off course a bit - my boyfriend wanted MORE meat and we ordered the dry-aged bone in Rib-Eye for 2. I didn't eat much as my boyfriend devoured it, but the meat was flavorful for sure...just not my style. Ending with the tasting menu desert, which I can't remember because it was so generic. I think creativity could have been a lot better.\n\nService was good and they helped us find wines to pair with our dinner well. Our server was so excited we wanted more steak - but maybe he just wanted the bigger tip resulting from the massive bill? The worst part of the meal was being seated in an area that looked out onto the casino/hotel walkway. I prefer people not staring at me or my meals when I eat. \n\nLastly, the price. While the cuts of meat were good, I just don't feel the costs justified what was done in the meal. The creativity was lacking and maybe it's because it's such a meat-BASED restaurant...but I feel like it could have been more creative. \n\nIf you liked dry-aged steak and big, bold Italian reds, this is the place for your. But I prefer my steak to melt like butter in my mouth and this isn't the place for it. I will tell you my boyfriend enjoyed it far more than I did.

I didn't see it available on their lunch menu :( \n- Stuffed Piquillo Peppers - so delish! especially if you like goat cheese & mushrooms. Was my second favorite dish! \n- Ahi Tuna Tempura - maybe because I love both Ahi Tuna & Tempura, but I thought this was just scrumptious\n- Tuna Raspberry Skewers - a nice twist of flavors. \n- White Ceviche - this ceviche was divine! My only complaint was it was a bit heavy on the lime, but then again I'm just not a lime fan ;) \n- Spanish Chicken Croquetas - kinda like fried mozzarella stick, but with chicken & creamy bechamel sauce! I really liked this. Note: I luv creamy/cheesy stuff.  \n- Grilled Lamp Chops - very tasty & tender\n\nGOOD!, but nothing to scream about: \n- Wild Mushroom Soup - again, it was really GOOD! but I would prefer getting a second order of something above if given a choice :) \n- Lobster Salad \n- Lobster Saffron\n- Beef & Cheese\n- Padron Peppers - i felt like it was a bit too salty (this coming from someone who LOVES salt!) Also, it's probably more ideal as a sampler dish for a large party. For my table of 2, I felt like I had enough after a few bites, and felt padron pepper'd out by the time we finished the plate :op\n- Brava Potatoes - don't get me wrong, it was delicious. but as it's a pretty filling dish, i just felt that these were not out of this world, and I'd rather fill up on one of the many other tapas choices they have to offer\n\nOverall, it was so delicious.

The hostess were very snotty and I was not told any party that's isn't for two must check in with the hostess and they will text you when your table is ready. I waited for about 20 mins before a hostess came to get information for each couple. At that point I was told to give them my information. There was a huge misunderstanding.

When we first started eating there it was absolutely excellent.  Our last few visits, today and last week were not good at all.  First off the salad bowl used to be filled almost to the top with greens, last two visits there were a good 1 1/2\" from the top (really?) of course the condiments are alwyas put on with a tiny baby spoon, usually not even half full of content, but I get that and am ok with that, but what also doesn't seem right is that if you get a \"large\" size salad, you still get the small size condiments?  Additionally, the honey mustard dressing must have been diluted because it has absolutely no taste and of course was minimally applied.  Another major concern is that while eating the salad, it seemd very gritty, almost like there was sand or dirt on the leaves?  Bad taste as well.  I used to get the lobster bisque but quite ordering that because it seemd that they putting more filler stuff \"celery\" etc. in it and less pieces of lobster.  The Tomato Basil is still very good so that's my go to for soup, assuming we ever go back.\nAs for customer service?  Spotty at best.  Today the server behind the counter at the soup ask if I wanted any soup, I said yes, a small Tamato Basil.  I got up to the register (very crowded) and there was no soup?  The server of the soup had this blank stare on her face like \"did you want soup\"?  Then the cash registers were not working properly and we stood at the counter with our soup getting colder by the minute and 4 to 5 minutes later we finally got to sit and eat.  Only other comment (not a good one) is that the water out of one of the soft drink dispenser tasted very bad?  Not sure why but certainly something to be concerned about.  Well, that's it folks!

Between the personal recommendations and the fawning of the print and online food community, the decision wasn't too hard to make to try it out. (The fact that it was voted one of the best new restaurants of 2011 by Toronto Life definitely didn't hurt.)\n\nWe popped into Kalendar for a drink beforehand (check out the rojo martini if you go. Most excellent.) and watched the world go by, including the chef of Grace, Top Chef Canada contestant Dustin Gallagher. Mental note: must get to Grace! We wandered over to Woodlot and as soon as we opened the door, the aroma from that spectacular wood-burning oven wafted over us. Figuring that was a good sign, we inhaled deeply and sat down at our cozy table. The restaurant looks like it seats about 50 on the upper floor with room for another 10 or so downstairs at the chef's table. The exposed brick walls are adorned with native Canadian art as well as knickknacks that lend a cottage-like vibe to the place. The waiters are dressed casually and it is explained to us that there is a standard menu, plus a separate vegetarian menu. I perused it quickly and was impressed to find a nice selection that didn't fit into the standard roast-veg-or-pasta options.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of cabernet franc and eventually settled on three courses: the scallop ceviche with black quinoa, whipped avocado and julienned red cabbage; Red Fife whole wheat papardelle with wood mushrooms and hazeluts; whey-fed pork chop with grilled treviso, tri-tip steak with caramelized onions and side of Jerusalem artichokes.\n\nWhen the bread basket arrived at the table after placing our order, we jumped right in. My dining companion loves bread and watching his face light up after taking that first bite of the gorgeous Red Fife bread was wonderful! I'd read about this particular grain in Sara Elton's book, Locavore, and was excited to check it out. It kind of makes regular bread taste entirely pathetic. We'd both had a couple of pieces of the various kinds when the appetizer arrived. The scallops were soft, the avocado was whipped into a lovely, airy bubble and these textures were complimented well with the crunchy quinoa and cabbage. I wish there'd been more of it, but we weren't exactly going to starve.\n\nNext up was the papardelle which was out of this world. Again, the Red Fife made a huge difference in terms of flavour. The wide, handmade noodles were cooked perfectly and provided much more dimension to the dish than you'd have otherwise. It was a very earthy plate, one that you wanted to hunker down with in front of a fire and never stop eating. I hope that's on the menu year 'round, because I would have it again and again.\n\nThe service at Woodlot is quite good, if not entirely exceptional. Importantly, however, they let you enjoy your meal in peace and the timing in between courses is well paced. We needed a little time between the hearty pasta and giant slabs of meat that would imminently arrive at our table. And giant slabs of meat they were: delicious, juicy, perfectly-cooked pieces of meat. My pork chops had that little layer of fat around the outside that you know you probably shouldn't eat, but can't help yourself because you know how good it is. The grilled treviso was a perfect compliment, too. The steak was exactly medium-rare as  ordered and was incredibly tender. The caramelized onions were an excellent accompaniment - in fact, I'd eat a whole bowl of those if they sold them. Even the Jerusalem artichokes were great - caramelized and not overcooked.\n\nTo say that we savoured every bite is not an understatement. Nothing was complicated (though I have a spot in my heart for complex food) or overwrought: in fact, we saw several dishes come out on wooden cutting boards. Dessert was very tempting, but we passed this time. I'd like to go back in the cooler months as I'm dying to try the marrow-infused whipped potatoes.  Of course, I also want to go back so I can eat ALL the bread that's there.\n\nSo there you have it. Great food, cozy and welcoming atmosphere. It's tough to get reservations on a weekend, but the hostess with whom I spoke to make our reservations was gracious and as accommodating as could be. I will definitely be making return trips here!", "date": "2011-11-28", "cool": 1, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "business_id": "27_N5P9HZ86IviONPT_twg", "stars": 4}, {"useful": 3, "funny": 2, "review_id": "thXhMCBeDU4Ht-o1EEPDdA", "text": "Despite all of the new multi-story buildings going up in the area, the Entertainment district is still full of lively, exciting, cool and truly unique places to check out; from the theatres to the restaurants, it is a great area to spend a night or two and explore.

They offer up a nicely balanced menu of traditional Cajun-style grub and the more typical Canadian restaurant fare; from fish and fried foods galore, to goat-cheese-adorned salads and honey-garlic chicken, there really is something for everyone.\n\nI popped in early and was greeted with the notice of half-priced appetizers before 8:00 p.m. - a great opportunity to try a couple.  There are plenty of barbecued chicken, rib and steak platters to choose from, but what could be more appropriate than their cornmeal crusted catfish sticks?  I had them with the goat cheese and Cajun-roasted pistachio salad, and it turned out to be a delightful meal.\n\nThe catfish sticks are a must. After I ordered, a small plate with one tiny morsel of something arrived in front of me - this was worrisome.  Thankfully, it was just a mini-muffin sized, mildly sweet portion of cornbread (a side note: not enough restaurants give you complimentary bread at the table anymore; it does not have to be an overflowing basket of buns, but just a small bite of something light and delicious starts the meal off right). When the fish did arrive, I was more than impressed with the serving size. They were light and crispy and with smokey-sweet Cajun spice and served a tangy tartar sauce.\n\nThe salad had a hint of that same Cajun spice on the pistachios, but was otherwise just as expected for greens, except for one crucial detail - the copious amount of cheese!  Finally, a restaurant after my own dairy-loving heart!  I have too often overpaid for goat-cheese-promising pastas and salads that have fallen short.  Joe Mamas, on the other hand, gave me a meal-size salad, with more than my fair share of cheese, and all at half-price no less!\n\nI eased myself into my first southern cuisine experience with a dinner of appetizers, worried that I might be confronted with an over-spiced and over-fried spread.

We're recent arrivals, and were so disappointed with the dog park in Champaign -- basically a boring piece of dirt with a bedraggled tree or two  surrounded by an entirely too short 4 ft. fence. Someone suggested checking out the Urbana dog park (they have reciprocity between the two parks) - it's like night and day! The Urbana park has several wide swaths of open, grassed area that is perfect for dashing around, frisbee, tennis balls, or just running for a dog's sheer joy of running.  The grassed areas are punctuated by some meadow-like areas of prairie grass, which was pretty in the late summer with wildflowers, although I was a little nervous about the possibility of snakes.  There's a very welcome wooded area with benches -- some really lovely big trees provide shade.  The park is well-cared for, with lots of mulch in well-traveled areas, lots of doggie bags (but only one trash can, by the gate - still trying to figure that one out), fresh water, a hose for those \"roll in the dirt\" days, and even a port-o-potty for humans who can't hike a leg by the nearest tree. There's a separate small area for small dogs, too, but it doesn't seem to be used very much -- a lot of people bring their small dogs into the \"big dog\" section, but it would depend on how comfortable your dog is around other dogs. \n\nWith our escape artist dog, who considers any fence a challenge to be conquered, we were especially concerned about gaps in the fence, so one of the first things we did was walk the perimeter carefully.  Any areas that look as though a dog might be able to quickly dig under have been blocked with large rocks, and the gates are well-fitted, preventing a dog from nosing out in gaps caused by sagging gates.  And the fence is a good, 6' high chain link--perfect for jumpers like mine. That 4 ft. fence in Champaign would just be a suggestion, if mine saw a squirrel on the other side.  \n\nThe picture on the Urbana Parks website, http://www.urbanaparks.org/facilities/55.html,  is a horrible one and makes it look like an urban wasteland.  Click on the video on that page, and you'll see just how pretty this dog park is.

There was also a little section welcoming and thanking customers, with some history of the place included, a nice touch.\n\nOur meals arrived exactly 9 minutes after ordering, pretty fast, and considering they were full on packed, quite impressive. \n\nThe meal was good, but nothing spectacular. The bread was pre-buttered which I'm always in favor of. There was also a small shredded apple salad included which was lovely and complimented the rest of the dish nicely. When I asked for ketchup, it was served in a shot glass, hmm. Although I was satisfied with my portion size, the rest of my table was not. Total bill for the two of us, $30.\n\nOverall, nice food, nice buzz but a bit overpriced.", "date": "2011-05-02", "cool": 0, "user_id": "MGU_MeGj51wBjhD0T8vUgA", "business_id": "DizSoX0FqH_EvXSHW6wEIQ", "stars": 3}, {"useful": 2, "funny": 0, "review_id": "rpr5eWAd0K6_m-bIyFpIxA", "text": "Don't waste your time.

The guys that work there were really helpful, and being able to order by the inch as opposed to by the slice or a whole pizza allows you to try more than 1 type (Perfect for those of us who are indecisive) and people who can't power down a whole pie.  They also have a huge gelato selection (I recommend the butter pecan!) and cappuccino. It is hidden in there by Powder and Sun and Massage Nirvana (by Peace/Ft Apache). Great product, great prices great service--A triple threat and I really hope this one stays around. We really need more than the big 3 (PH, PH, D) to choose from without paying 25 dollars for a small pizza just to avoid a chain", "date": "2011-12-24", "cool": 1, "user_id": "GZI0VPDn2FXvq-SQJckrTg", "business_id": "fOzVez6UBi9LPIcC8OJFew", "stars": 5}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "G5si735PMbQcLE760HRu-g", "text": "Awesome office!

Not only that: She feeds her dogs raw as well!\nAs many boxer owners would understand: I have gotten used to automatically apologizing for my dog's behaviour.  We started with daycare with Antoinette and each day I went to pick up my dog, bracing for Antoinette to say: \"Sorry, this dog has way too much energy...I cannot allow her to come back\".  But each time I picked her up, I brought home an EXHAUSTED and better behaved dog.  Antoinette would tell me about their HOURS long hikes and how great my dog is.  I noticed a huge change in my dog almost immediately.  She listened, she has learned how to control her enthusiasm, she no longer jumps and most of all: she has learned how to properly interact with other dogs.  Not only that, I have also learned how to watch her interactions with other dogs and read situations.

Of course I went here as I was in AZ on a business trip, and was staying not far from this place. I was in my hotel room (thinking about just ordering room service), when someone I knew had posted a comment about the Kitchen Nightmare episode on FB. I then decided to look up the episode on HULU (this was not long after airing), then realizing I was not far from there, I decided to go. Uggg... I could tell just walking in that the kitchen was in distress. The old guy was sweating like a fat man in a marathon behind the touch screen computer. He had several tickets in his hand, and was having trouble with the technology. There were shouts from the back and a lot of loud banging from the kitchen. I noticed only one table had their entr\u00e9e. That table seem unimpressed with their food. one other table got some appetizer shortly after I was seated, I heard one person remark \"will I have to wait another 45min for my dinner\" The time frame got my attn., because it looked like a simple pita and hummus type appetizer.The old man responded curtly to this comment but with his accent I could not understand what he said. When he left the table, the group kinda snickered. There were like 2-3 other groups/couples waiting that just had drinks. My waitress was very polite, and attentive she kept my glass full. I noticed she stayed away from a couple tables, until someone asked her to fill their water glass. She did as asked, and the old man noticed and scolded her telling her that they were HIS customers, and she is NOT to serve them. Even when the customer tried to explain to him that he just wanted some water, the old man responded \"You do not tell me how to run my business! I am the boss here you are not.. if you want water you have to come through me, not her...\" I then realized why she avoided those tables. My order was taken... I ordered the Chicken Parm. \nI waited for a while, even though I fully intended to, I forgot to mark the time I placed my order, but it seemed like an eternity when I did start clocking (I imagine 15-20min later) still the waitress was kind, and kept my glass full. about 30 min later the old man placed and Eggplant Parm in front of me. He was still sweaty, and had some strong odors about him. At this point my sense of humor was thin, and when he placed the wrong dish in front of me I called him on the fact that I was her customer and not his. He argued with me insisting that he took my order for an Eggplant Parm. The table kinda caddy corner from me actually got up, and informed him that THEY had ordered that dish over an hour ago, and that they herd me order the Chicken parm. The old man continued to argue till the waitress had to confirm my order with the original hand written ticket. I will say at that point, the old man said \"I am sorry, but you know how it is... it is confusing...\" The other customer and I rolled our eyes he sat at his table with his wife (who had no food in front of her) and I returned to waiting. Well I got my meal the same time the other gentleman's wife got hers - about 15min later. \nMy meal was an undercooked chicken that was supposed to be baked, but somehow was greasy. and when I mean undercooked, the thick part of the chicken was RAW, BLOODY RAW! It was NOT crispy the breading was soggy, mostly from the weird pasta situation. It looked as if they used a non slotted spoon to pull the pasta from the pot, because there was A LOT of water on my plate. and I am not sure the physics behind this, but somehow, they managed to have both overcooked and undercooked pasta on my plate.

When they started eating the wife threw her fork on the plate and said, I can't take another bite of this $%!+ ! The husbands eyes and mine caught each others. He came to my table with his plate in hand. He asked me to taste his Eggplant Parm. I tried to cut his Eggplant Parm, but it was REAL tough, I managed to get a small piece, and it tasted like dirt - literally! We both took our complaint to the old man, and he started arguing with us concerning the quality of his food. I pointed out the blood, he said \"Good! Hope it kills you, then you will never bother me again\". The other couple slipped out, didn't pay the check (don't blame them) but that left me - the old man insisted that I not only pay my tab, but the other couples too.

And if that's all you're looking for, Marathon will not disappoint.\n\nIf you're like me, however, and expect good, African flavour for your money, I suggest you look elsewhere. The stews - I had their staple beef, chicken, lamb, and chickpea stews  - are all fairly uninteresting, many of them rich in the flavour of their tomato base and little else. If it hadn't been for the somewhat smokey lamb, I'd liken the experience to eating pasta with tomato sauce at a cheap Italian chain restaurant.  For what you are paying - e.g.: $18/person if you do the dinner combo platter - the serving sizes are quite small and though the injera is plentiful, it is too bland to eat on its own. \n\nIt's unfortunate because there are not many options for Ethiopian/Eritrean food in the city. Perhaps the demand just isn't there. But I can't help but wonder if Marathon's lack-luster (and expensive!) execution of the genre may be partly to blame.", "date": "2013-04-11", "cool": 0, "user_id": "xOzoC81Eo76JoDpfdbNNbw", "business_id": "EHMtdSez8MdjZBUOptgWcg", "stars": 2}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "nguTJkj5G7sFaI3pmXp04w", "text": "I have to say that this was the nicest dealership that I have been to in a long time.

The wife had the Elk and upgraded her sides to the creamed corn casserole, I had the lamb. Both are farm bred in New Zealand and both were delicious. My sides were the brocolini and garlic mashed potatoes. Appetizer was the calamari, very good with a slightly sweet taste to the breading. Dessert was an apple galleta.

There were also cooking demonstrations using, of course, GARLIC, as well as live music on two stages. Here are a few of our favorites:\n\n* Sergio's Sarava's Garlic Shrimp: Sergio's really took the theme to heart and made a savory shrimp with big garlic flavor and presented it on a bed of garlic rice to boot! This one really hit the mark on celebrating garlic. Loved it!\n\n* Most interesting - Garlic Ice Cream by Mitchell's: we had to try it... everyone should try it... it actually did work! As a side note, they also had the most unbelievable caramel and salt ice cream. Just go try it, your jaw will drop.\n\n* Roasted Garlic Salsa from Blaze Gourmet (so big and flavorful - one of the best salsas out there, and it's local!)\n\n* Garlic Expressions Salad Dressing (yep, it's local too - we've been buying this for years.)\n\n* The Olive and the Grape's many Garlic Olive Oils, Cooking Oils, and spice packets. The spices they incorporate are not the basic stuff, these delightful blends are carefully scrutinized with a passion for the highest quality, healthiest ingredients from all over the world.\n\n* Whole Foods' extremely pungent, spicy garlic hummus. That says it all. Whoa.\n\nOur only criticism is that there were some who showcased their regular fare without doing something creative with garlic. We expected everything to be garlic something. Hence, Garlic Festival. One of those things that's basically implied, if you don't love garlic, then don't come. So we challenge participants next year to bring out the garlic.

We already moved 4 times in 15 years and this was the worse and most expensive. Let me give you some details:\nA) Packing of household property : One member of the crew broke a glass vase and unfortunately, my wife cut her foot. We expect that small accidents can happen during packing and moving of the household but we expect to be promptly notified so we can clean the damage and prevent personal injury. We were very concerned since we have a 9 year old, a 5 year old and a 17 month old that walked barefoot though the house!!. A member of the crew packed \"forbidden\" cleaning products such as opened bottles of bleach, ammonia, aerosols  and other chemicals. We had to unpack those ourselves and notified the crew leader. The master bedroom clothing was not appropriately packed since the shoes were placed on top of clean clothes without any paper in between, causing unnecessary stain of the clothing. Silk ties were thrown all together with belts in a box causing damage to the former piece of clothing. Kids markers, some of the them without the cover and unwrapped in paper, were also thrown in boxes mixed with towels causing staining. The United crew from our destination (this was a long distance move) found the furniture poorly padded and indicated that was the reason to find damage and severe scratches to several pieces of our furniture.  The carpet of the house was not appropriately covered and protected with consequent significant staining. A sales person came to our house to see that damage and recognized the error.  She asked us to clean it ourselves!!!\nB)Transport of the household: Unfortunately, all our household property was not loaded in a single truck as we were told. The driver indicated that this issue happens frequently during that time of the year since it is very busy for moving companies. I was told that I should not worry since the overflow load was going to be delivered at the same time than the main load. The initial load was delivered within those dates but not the rest of the household as were told. It arrived 10 days later! The inventory of the first load was incorrect and there were over 50 items without tag (more than can be blamed on transportation issues). Several items were missing and it was unclear to us if they were going to be present in the overflow load. This caused additional and unexpected expense. A critical item for us was the vacuum cleaner since 3 of our family members have  asthma and our new house had carpet in all the rooms. The vacuum cleaner was one of the items missing in the original inventory. My 5 year old son started to become symptomatic and we were authorized by Reynolds to purchase a vacuum and we were told that we would be reimbursed. \nC) Transportation of the automobiles: Our contract was signed for two different ways to transport and delivery of our two cars. The first car was supposed to be delivered within 5 days (at a premium price). Both cars were late. The worse part was the manager agreed to reimburse us for additional expenses such as the vacuum, dry cleaner bills and broken items.I was quite naive to pay them after  Reynolds agree to reimburse us. Months past by and the manager stop answering my calls and complaints.", "date": "2012-05-10", "cool": 0, "user_id": "MGyV8Q5nMCEJR_F03-Osiw", "business_id": "CzDIK991vffAj9dfHjqYjQ", "stars": 1}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "DhBYXDQINb1V1FaZe_egbg", "text": "I have been here many times during the lunch rush.

I booked 2 nights this past weekend and it was going to be my first time staying at Mandalay Bay so my boyfriend and I were very excited. I booked our room through the actual Mandalay Bay website. At check-in, we were told that our room would have 2 queen beds when I had reserved one king. They said that they were booked and that's all they had. They didn't offer any other accommodations and that pretty much we were stuck with a room we didn't want. We were upset since they had already charged the first night on my card and we would lose that if we cancelled. I asked to speak with a Supervisor and the employee simply said, \" ok, he will just tell you what I just said.\"\nI spoke with the Supervisor or Manager and at first he said the same thing but I after I kept trying to make my point, they told us that we could wait a few hours and when a room would become available they would change our room. They took down my number because all of a sudden a room had just became available but they needed about 40 mins to clean it. We waited more than 45 mins and no call back. I called the desk and asked about my room, a female employee said that they could not move us now since we had already checked in! OMG! I asked to speak with the manager and she said that he was on the phone and he would call me back. We were furious! I did receive a call back from another manager and he apologized for all the trouble and moved us to another room. Besides the halls reeking of marijuana and the walls being so thin that we could hear conversations, the room was ok. After freshening up, we went down to the casino in desperate need of a drink. We started to gamble and saw two cocktail waitresses walking by in a deep conversation. My boyfriend waived to them and they said, \"oh, yeah, yeah, someone will be with you,\"  they also ignored another customer after us. Another waitress went by and she didn't even stop and told us she would be back...she also ignored the other customer. That customer looked at us and said, \"is that how it works? Isn't that why we come to Vegas? To play and gamble? I'm just going to the bar and tip the bartender...I'm sure he'll appreciate my tip.\" \nReally? This place had the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED! The check-in trouble, the cocktail waitresses, the bath towels were hard, hardly any tv channels available, it was mainly casino advertising. Toiletries were not stocked after cleaning the room. The whole place reeked of marijuana. We simply went to play and eat at other casinos. I didn't think Mandalay Bay deserved our money. I was expecting much more from this place, but I will not be staying at this casino in the future.", "date": "2013-05-07", "cool": 0, "user_id": "NyPrDU7vm0aQsjIQG_Gm0g", "business_id": "eAc9Vd6loOgRQolMXQt6FA", "stars": 2}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "zyoqAEozd8zLKG8CK2P7Yg", "text": "The taco itself is good.

In the 90's this hotel was new, nice and accommodating, in 2013-not so much.\n\nThe hotel is now old, outdated, a bit dirty and most of the employees seem very unhappy.  We stayed here because we were on a family vacation and 2 of the 3 nights were free.  Next time I think we will pay the extra money to stay elsewhere.\n\nThe employees at the front desk are far from friendly.  After getting a room with a view of a block wall and no sky, we were able to change to a room with a view of the Luxor.  The front desk employee begrudgingly changed our room after I complained and explained to her what I was told when making the reservations (I was told we would receive a room with a view of the South Strip for no extra charge).\n\nThe rooms are pretty decent as far as decor and cleanliness go.  The bathroom could sure use a makeover, but was clean enough. The a.c. was the original unit from 1990. The casino is old, dark, dingy and not very lucky!  It was almost impossible to get a \"free\" drink.  I played for over 45 minutes nonstop and no waitress was to be found (and no winning either!).  I swear the casinos in Southern California have better odds of winning.\n\nThe swimming pool was down right scary.  My 8 year old son begged to go swimming, so we did.  He ended up getting sick and throwing up that night and I'm convinced it was the pool water.  The pool was filled with adults and kids from age 1 to 15, the water was too warm and very cloudy.  After getting out of the pool, I realized there wasn't even a hint of chlorine smell on our swim clothes, not good.  The restrooms in the pool area were absolutely disgusting.  I won't go into details, use your imagination, it will most likely be spot on.\n\nThe only reason I even give it 2 stars is because the prices are low and they have a pretty nice arcade for kids.  They could really use a 24 hour cafe type restaurant (they used to have one years ago).  You are forced to go to fast food, expensive eats or leave the hotel and go elsewhere.\n\nAll in all, I don't recommend the Excalibur unless you are on a really tight budget and are terrified of staying at Circus Circus (like we were).", "date": "2013-07-20", "cool": 1, "user_id": "gxGjqtKkq-7Z4Gpjw1JTSQ", "business_id": "o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w", "stars": 2}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "43_KljXYSQsGubmckI4L2w", "text": "Located in a sketchy neighborhood this quaint hole in the wall certainly doesn't disappoint and you can't beat the price!!", "date": "2010-07-30", "cool": 0, "user_id": "altw5Ky3eroLAjLSZCEVvg", "business_id": "gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg", "stars": 4}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "ptuQuV2TKxH78Yfg6Yz-VQ", "text": "It's always nice when there's a gluten free menu section but not when its executed so poorly.

We had a rather large party and we were seated in the 'wine cellar\".  What a fantastic area of this historic steak house. The wine cellar is two-story high and has about 20,000 bottles! \n\nOur server (Ange) had obviously been in his trade for many years because he was flawless. Ange answered all of our questions with dignity and respect but brought in a nice sense of humor as well. He made some wonderful recommendations. During the meal he anticipated our needs before we did. Ange blended in nicely with all the members of the party and it was a pleasure to spend the evening with him.\n\nAll the food and wine was delicious.

I later tried to contact her; however, she would take so long to respond, I had to ask if she was even still interested in catering our wedding. Once she responded, she mentioned that we should meet up to further discuss. Since we do not live in Las Vegas, we had to plan a special trip to meet her. Chef Megan was nice enough, but she was extremely scatterbrained! After we perfected our order and paid a deposit, we wanted to try some pies. They only had mini berry pies available, so we said that we would love to try one. That was no problem, and then she proceeded to ring us up...for the $4 pie. I was a little taken back that we were buying $600 in pie, and she charged us to taste a mini $4 pie!? One the day of the wedding, I received an email saying that the pies had been delivered; however, they forgot something in the order, so could I please pick it up. Of course I can't pick it up - I'm getting married, and I've already paid you $80 to deliver everything!! By the way, the $80 delivery is literally just that - they do not set anything up; rather, they just hand the pies off to the venue. \n\nThe pies were pretty good; some were better than the others. I think that this little business could really be amazing if Chef Megan stayed in the kitchen and hired someone to run the place.

I should start off by saying that my friends visiting from Philadelphia and DC were surprised by how high the prices were.  The food was, as always, well-executed, but the service was so unpleasant and condescending that it was hard to enjoy the experience.  One of us is vegetarian and we asked if it would be possible to get the meat on the side for two of the dishes.  This seemingly innocuous request was met with a snide quip that \"the chef doesn't believe in customizing his menu for the customer.\"  Fair enough, but I should mention that the vegetarian version of the dish is the same price and that we were directed to the sides menu if we wanted to pay for a similar protein to that left off of our order for $4 which we grudgingly obliged to do.  When the dish arrived, it was not in fact the vegetarian version we had ordered which we discovered as we started to dish it onto our plates.  They did replace the item promptly, but also snatched our plates with the food that had already been dished by the non-vegetarians which at that point seemed petty and wasteful.

During certain hours, the prices of drinks and food would vary, from lowest prices about 4 pm, and higher prices into the evening. We got there about 6 pm, when the price for a selected menu was $6 each item, and the price of a drink was $7. These were supposed to be happy hour, or discounted, prices. The regular price for a draft of domestic beer was $7. I assumed the happy hour price would be less than $7, so I ordered 2 Buds. The price turned out to be $7 each. No discount at all. On the food menu, the regular price for the steak street tacos was $18, The price for the happy hour was $6. That looked like a good deal, so I ordered it. Several minutes later, the server brought out a corn tortilla, about the size of a small bagel. On it was a tiny amount of cheese, and a little spoonful of meat. I asked the waitress if this was the regular price, and she said the regular price of $18 was for three of these minuscule servings.  I pointed out that each would then be $6, which was the happy hour price. In other words, for the happy hour you get one taco for $6, but the regular price was 3 for $18, which is $6. So, the beer and the taco were exactly the same price for the happy hour and the regular menu. Very Deceptive. My advice - before ordering at this restaurant, be very careful. They really offer no happy hour deals. By the way, the taco was OK, but not worth $6.

I paid $420.00 and met with Noel after his inspection.  Noel found numerous areas of concern. One violation which Noel stated was \"extremely dangerous\" was a vent over the microwave oven which was open to the roof. This vent was a few inches from an outlet. Noel stated this must be capped at the roof because rain could come into the vent and short the electrical outlet causing a fire. Because I wanted to be sure the repairs were done correctly, I asked Noel to come back to re inspect the home. Noel gave a thumbs up and said everything was great. I then went to the home to check it out only to discover the \"dangerous\" repair had been done with duct tape. No repair had been made on the roof as required by Noel's original report. Apparently Noel did not reinspect as directed (Yes, I had to pay again this time it was $185.00). When I complained to Tim at the office he said \"Noel may have been in a hurry.\" Nice to know Noel was willing to let my home burn to the ground and possible death to myself because he was rushed and couldn't be bothered to reinspect properly.

The sauce tastes fresh and balanced (bordering slightly on sweet). \nIf you expect to find the gobs of generic \"cheese\" found in most pizza places you won't find it at Grimaldi's. They use fresh mozzarella and it barely covers the pizza crust but it is fresh and delicious and you can taste it in every bite. And if that's not enough, the pizza is not greasy at all! \nIt is satiating without bloating you up and making you feel like you ate an anvil.\n\nAs for toppings I usually order their red peppers and maybe some extra cheese or sauce. I have tried adding chicken but the pizza ended up very moist. \n\nTheir Mediterranean salad is fresh and a decent serving.\n\nThe cheesecake is pretty good, not artificially and overly sweet like some others, sweet enough to taste like dessert while also tasting fresh.\n\nService has been very good and the staff has been very attentive.\nThere is some outdoor seating which is great, especially when it's windy.\nInside the decor makes you feel like you're in NY with pictures, street signs, rail signs etc.\n\nOverall one of the best pizza places in the valley and the best for oven baked pizza.

The portions are small, but it was fun for our group to order several different items and share them all. We ordered the burrata special, which was excellent and crostini appetizer, which was good. Then, I had the beef shank and my husband had the venison special. I was slighly disappointed there were no seafood options on the menu or specials, but I think that was reflective of seasonal and local fresh ingredients being utilized. Although the flavors on both our meat dishes were very similar, they were both delicious. The best part of the dining experience at Osteria Papavero is dessert. I know it sounds crazy (as our friends reiterated to us before we went), but the butterscotch pudding is to die for. Try it with their home made lemoncello and you will not be sorry. The prices are slightly high, but the quality is well worth the price. \n\nI have one criticism of Osteria Papavero and it is that there are too many specials not documented on the menu. I am not complaining about them having so many specials, because what we tried of them were great. I'm more critical of the fact that the specials were not really documented anywhere, so it was hard to keep track of them. Our waitress spent at least 5 minutes at our table explaining the 7 specials. Although the items were listed with a one word description on a blackboard, it was on the other side of the restaurant from where we were seated, and no one at our table could read it. Even if we were able to read the board, there were no descriptions of the specials, so after the waitress left our table, we had forgotten some of what she described and had to ask her to repeat items when she returned.

Based on reviews we had high expectations. The restaurant has a casual, authentic ambiance with lots of people celebrating the holiday season. My husband and nephew had Sukiyaki with a tray of fresh ingredients which they cooked as they ate. Their dinner was ready in about 10 minutes. My daughter had Chirashi  which arrived shortly after from the sushi bar. After more than an hour passed, I asked the waitress about my Salmon Teriyaki, a simple item to prepare. She rushed into the kitchen and informed me it was coming but there were many orders ahead. After 15 minutes more, another waitress told me the Thursday evening Chef was \"slow\" and suggested I order from the sushi bar. My choices had to exclude items that involved the Chef in any way (e.g., soft shell crab for Spider Roll). I chose Makisushi and California Roll. After another 10 minutes, the waitress returned looking stressed since the Chef had made my dinner and would be upset if I cancelled. So, I accepted the dinner. The plate had two slices of Pacific salmon which were overcooked and served with a dollop of uninspired potato salad. The Japanese love mayonnaise but this was not delicious potato salad. To compensate for the Chef's fiasco in the kitchen the waitress brought us a special dessert - oranges! My daughter commented that this was the standard fruit served at the end of Ematei meals. I cannot recommend Ematei, unless you are prepared to wait endlessly and do not mind accommodating an unhappy Chef, frightened waitresses and unconcerned management!
