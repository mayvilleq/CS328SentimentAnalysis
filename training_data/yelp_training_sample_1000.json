The Peach Stand is a Fort Mill landmark for a reason. There is a small ice cream parlor and country restaurant. But the best parts are the mini grocery store including local produce & local products and of course the butcher shop. \n\nThere are quite a number of things I pick up there regularly. Number 1 is RAW MILK!!!! Its is a foodie's delight. There is nothing like a cold glass of milk with just a bit of cream that rises to the top. They also import some of the best, reasonably priced, balsamic vinegar and olive oil around. The balsamic is aged and has a nice sweet flavor. It makes you understand why people commonly pair good balsamic with strawberries. The olive oil is fresh and has a nice flavor. Pick up some of the manicotti they have in the freezer along with a jar of David's secret tomato sauce and a chunk of bread. Viola, dinner. \n\nAhhh the butcher shop... how I love thee....... They will cut meat to order if you wish them to ( I wanted an unusual cut and they were happy to help) plus they have a good selection. Their apple wood smoked bacon and fresh sausage are perfect for making Sunday brunch. I have had their kabobs, which were full of flavor and tender. Their house made sausages, fresh chicken and meat are great. I'm sure if they don't have it, they can get it for you, just ask them. They also carry Boar's Head deli products. \n\nOne of the things that really makes this place stand out is their commitment to carrying a lot of local products. Being South Carolina, of course they have a lot of peach products including preserves, cider and when in season, fresh peaches of course. One of the most surprising peach products are peach wood chips for your smoker. I learned that some of the peach wood also goes to a local artist for his projects. Another favorite of mine is \"May's Unique Vinaigrette\" salad dressing. They also carry Hidden Acre Farm products (out of Rock Hill) including coarse ground grits which are a must for shrimp and grits, local popcorn as well as dip, bread & soup mixes from the same farm, packaged in cute mini brown paper packages with home style labels (a few in a basket make great hostess gifts).

We try to prioritize what we want to see and go based off what we want to see.

I personally never got a chance to check out the North Hall but I believe that's usually where all the cars for the year are shown. \n\nThere is no need to park directly here at the convention since most hotels offers a shuttle that will bring you here and bring you back after the show is over! There is also a food court inside the convention center right outside of the South Hall when you need to grab a quick bite before going back into the Geek convention of the year!

However, Wicked Spoon is the other way around.  This place totally not worth the dollar that we paid.  For $40 per person, I rather go to a better restaurant in Vegas and pick the dishes I like and well prepared!\n\nFirst of all, we went to Wicked Spoon on Monday night, we waited for 10min and got seated.  The service is just okay and got what I need.  However, I guess we are so lucky that maybe the regular chef are on their holiday and the food whoever prepared is not good at all....\n\nFirst I tried the Prime rib, I've never ate a prime rib that is so bad.  It's over cooked.....It was hard and dry...20 min later, I tired another slice from another batch.  Too bad, it's the same as the first one...hard and dry.  I give up on the Prime rib... and tried the Roast Lamb leg.  The chef cut a slice in the middle and it was RARE & RED.  I don't mind it's rare but it's too hard that I can't even chew or swallow ...FAIL!\n\nAlso, there's a long line waiting for the chef to make shrimp/clam/mussel, at least 10 people in line all the time waiting for 1 chef to prepare them for you.  You only get a small portion and I feel bad to ask for more so I line up again....That's 10-15 min of wait each time I line up.  I can't imagine how you can get the food during weekend...\n\nMoreover, their choice of food are very limited.  No sushi/sashimi/seafood.  What they have are only small crap legs and sushi cut rolls with lots of rice who try to fill you up.  If you are looking forward for seafood or Japanese food/sushi, stay away from here.\n\nLastly, their dessert are okay.  Mostly chocolate related, cakes and around 10 different kinds of Gelato.  However, I would also like to see some  melons.  (They have it but with cheese on top....Blah)\n\nOverall, if this place cost $20-$25, I will give it a 4 stars.

Being from LA, there are plenty food trucks and taco trucks etc., so seeing this small version of a food truck I couldn't pass up the chance.\n\nThis cart sells fusion Chinese dumplings with side salads.

OK, I may have exaggerated a little there, but they do have dumpling flavors that I never dreamed of. \n\nWe tried all the dumpling flavors just because they were pretty unique. I will list them in order of preference, though this in no way means that lower items are not good.\n\nSo Beefy:\nMy favorite among the selection. It's almost like a Chinese ravioli with beef, mushrooms, and cilantro. Sauce was a slightly spicy soy sauce vinaigrette which went really well with the dumpling.\n\nSo Authentic Pork:\nThis pork dumpling highlighted the sweetness of carrots that were mixed in amongst the pork. Sauce, if I can remember correctly was also soy sauce based.\n\nVeggie So Fiesta:\nThis was unique, a blend of Mexican and Chinese all in one. The filling of this taco... I mean dumpling, are filling and satisfying even without meat! Comes with a side of pico de gallo to top off this already cheese topped dumpling.\n\nSo Hot Chick:\nA play on buffalo chicken, comes with a creamy buffalo sauce. I think if this dumpling was deep fried.... Good bye buffalo wings!\n\nSo Gobbler:\nEver want a serving of turkey and cranberry mid-year, not only during thanksgiving? This dumpling will give you that fix. This was not on the top of my list, maybe I'm bias and I like my red meats better but if I ever crave a thanksgiving meal, I would just get a couple of these bad boys. Comes with cranberry sauce. Mom and Aunt's favorite.\n\nI got so caught up with the dumplings that I forgot to get a true taste of the salads haha! But the portions of salad are decent for lunch and a light dinner.

Exactly what I want in a restaurant in Montreal.\n\nFor mains we had a fish and the bison.  The bison is unforgettable.  The fish was very good, again, with a great combination of textures and flavors (pistachios, artichoke, lemon).

She went to the back to ask and came back and again told us no, claiming that the soup was made to order.  REALLY??   Soup is made to order but entrees aren't.  Rather ridiculous.

Both of these went very smoothly and they have a very affordable road hazard warranty available on tires that I purchased. I was hoping to get my AC fixed by them, but after they identified the problem with my AC as a leaking compressor that needed replaced, I was astounded by the price they quoted me at. They wanted to charge me $1200 for the compressor kit with the install. Most expensive kits peak around $350 tops. They explained that $280 was for labor and the rest was the kit. Their parts markups are insane and they were going to rip me off big time on labor too. I purchased the compressor at an O'Reilly's just a few hours later for about $250 and paid another mechanic for an hour and a half of labor to put it in. Under $400 for the whole job they wanted $1200 for. I read the reviews and thought it sounds like a good place with honest workers, but I was far off. Needless to say, I won't be back and you should proceed with caution. I don't believe this shop is trustworthy at all and I won't be back. Tires/alignments are pretty easy to get right and don't take a lot of work. The compressor situation really showed me their true colors.\n\nAfter seeing the comment from a representative of Tucker Tire and Auto, I feel there are a few details that merit clarification. First, the model I purchased was new, not refurbished. Second, while acknowledging that my compressor did not come with a two-year warranty, I distinctly recall the technician from Tucker Tire and Auto telling me that dropping the warranty would only save me about $50 (bringing my total down to $1150). Furthermore, after using the new compressor for just two days (and after my system having been refilled with coolant), my AC stopped working again, and what really needed placed initially was the condenser. I relied on the analysis of Tucker Tire and Auto to be accurate and I did not ask a second mechanic to double check; I simply paid him to install the compressor. In short, Tucker Tire and Auto wanted to charge me $1200 for a problem that did not exist. After my AC not working (a second time), the mechanic I brought it to checked out my system and quickly found that a part of a pipe connected to my condenser was really what was leaking coolant. Tucker Tire and Auto would have cost me much more for the part because they have deals set up with manufacturer's through which they only sell one type of compressor kit (and it's excessively pricier than other brands, not to mention they mark it up a healthy amount to get a nice profit from it). Furthermore, I would have had to return to Tucker to have the actual problem solved had I gotten the compressor replaced by them, because their \"warranty\" would not have covered my condenser. Lastly, the mechanic I paid to fix my AC took a total of two hours to replace my compressor AND my condenser. This cost me $200, as I paid him $100/hr. Tucker wanted triple the amount for labor and a ridiculous markup on the part. In my opinion, this is a pointed attempt to take advantage of a customer's lack of knowledge, and one that I'm lucky I caught onto. This is nefarious behavior and I believe that there are an abundance of shops in the valley that behave much more honestly (from personal experience).", "useful": 1, "cool": 0, "user_id": "Pt8P2Wr7IdKWEifG432l1Q", "review_id": "jGEtw8XVj3UkzomnbLjXyA"}, {"date": "2012-12-30", "stars": 4, "funny": 3, "business_id": "h6Y1-KfN2XBkcrV85CS8yg", "text": "We really enjoyed this venue.

So Charles went online pulled up the information, printed it off, gave it to me and then sent me to Schumacher where he had been the Service Manager to see if the repair could be covered through a dealership always keeping me paramount in his concern as opposed to his own self-interest and the needs of his business.\n\nAfter a long delay like a couple of weeks Schumacher told me the best they could do was to do the repair and match Autohaus' bid of $3,000. Since I was already in a Dealer loaner car, I asked Charles if he would mind if I just had the repair done there since they had already ordered the parts and I was in their loaner and of course he said go right ahead but he had just lost a $3,000 repair that he was entitled to since he referred me there originally.\n\nThe repair was done and I paid $3,000 for what I felt should have been covered under a recall but wasn't. I was not a happy camper by any means!\n\nA few weeks ago I stopped in to ask Charles to listen to an unusual fan noise coming from my dashboard. When I was there he said do you know that your gas tank repair might be covered by a recall and I just received a notice of it.\n\nLong story short, I called Schumacher and spoke with the head of the service department and was told they would submit the paperwork to MB on my behalf. Hmmm, why didn't they call me and tell me about this???\n\nA few weeks later I got a check in the mail from MB for $3,000!!!

For some reason this church stood out to me above the other and so I decided to attend my first service on a sunday morning.  Let's just say I've been attending ever since that first day and love going to Central every weekend!  This church is amazing and God is doing so much with it not only in the Vegas valley but all over the world.\nI normally have gone to big churches in OC such as Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa and Harvest Church in Riverside so I felt right at home in a BIG church with 5 different service times on the weekend.  I know that many people feel that they get lost in the crowd because this church has so many attendee's but the staff does a great job at making you feel at home and that your a huge part of the congregation.  I really liked their motto \"A place where it's ok to not be ok\".  This really stood out to me because they know that people need someone to just listen and talk to or to help them out in a crisis and this church does just that.\nThey have all different types of programs for everyone...there is just too many to list...for more of that info it is great to call the church or go to their website. \nPastor Jud Wilhite is an amazing pastor and I like the fact that he tells it like it is and he's got great style, not only in the way he dresses, but the way he speaks...he really uses real life situations and scenarios and really just gets down to a level where you can apply all of his teachings to your everyday life.  I even like the fact that he writes so many of his own books and all the proceeds go back to the church to help out all of the ministries that it is doing.  He is a rockstar of a pastor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI travel alot and since I am from LA my time in Vegas is short.  I know that I will be leaving very soon and I will miss driving to the main Henderson campus.  I will miss the worship songs so much but one of the amazing things they have done is broadcasting their service live on the internet through their website or by logging in off of their facebook campus.  This is a great way for me to watch the service when I'm not in Vegas!\nThanks Central for so much that you do in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!

By being there early, the great thing was that the restaurant had lots of tables and lots of waiters to provide excellent service.  Rocking roll man!\n\nAnyways, our waiter was very pleasant and took care of us.  Water was filled, drinks were takened promptly.  \n\nWe ordered the following dishes:\nAppetizers -- Calamari and the Brushetta \n-- The calamari was a bit smaller than we expected.  However, it tasted very good with their pepper/lemon butter sauce (low fat ... hee hee)\n-- The bruschette was okay.  By the way, I am not a bruchette fan.  My wife loves it.  So, we have to order what she likes.  Personally, the bread is too hard for my likening.  Instead, I like warm rolls and butter ~ wish more restaurants have honey butter -- oooh la la...\n\nEntree:\n-- My wife ordered the Shrimp Scampi -- Of course, i tried it too.  I wished they had more shrimp though!  Yes, shrimp was cooked perfectly -- not overdone!  By the way, everytime we dine out, when they bring our meal, my fork is digging into her plate before they even put it down... and vice versa... we just love food.  I can't believe I am not the size of a Michelin Tire Dude now... I just happen to wear dark clothes, a cape, and shift my weight properly.. LOL...!!\n\n-- I ordered the Pasta Weesie... note: I orderd this because of the funky Weesie name.  Sounds like somebody peeing --- like taking a whizz... sometimes, I am so strange.  Back to the dish, it was really good.  I love the afredo sauce (good balance of taste and texture! and the sauteed mushrooms were yummy!).  Now, if they had shrimp AND chicken, it would have been great (kinda like the Macaroni Grille - where you can pick and choose items).\n\nDessert:\nWe both split a John Cole (basically, ice cream with caramel and some nuts on top -- of course, it is low fat -- just kidding)\n\nHonestly, for a party of two, we kinda ordered a bit too much food.  We had to bring some home for lunch the next day.  For 2 nice size appetizers, 2 main entrees, dessert, and drinks, our meal totals to a bit under $70 (excluding tips).

Firstly, the resort fee is ridiculous. The amenities do not justify the amount of the fee, period. Slowest internet ever and I had to go elsewhere to be able to get online. This is the second time we checked in and there was something wrong with the room as in this last time the safe didn't work. After wasting two hours after checking in to have this fixed (battery was dead) this is NOT how I want to start off my stay. Also there was some crusty stuff on the padded headboard!! YUK!!! I told housekeeping about it three times. It was never cleaned. One washcloth in bathroom....NOT \nokay, no fridge not okay, homeless people hanging out in the parking garage right by our new car! Had to pick up booze bottles under and around car everyday! Billing all screwed up on our bill and the manager gave me major attitude. This is NOT okay. Also, light burned out in room entryway. Told the front desk about it when I addressed the safe. Never changed it! Quality control is NOT here. WHO is checking the rooms!!! These things should be checked regularly.\nThe only plus is it's location some of the time! The music at night is loud. So if you want to go to bed early, good luck. Never heard from the hotel, they have never done anything for us since we started staying here. Even after I told them that we have stayed 3 times and 3 times things were NOT okay they just ignore us. So guess what people, we will ignore them. So many places to stay in Vegas that are way better. The bones are here but it is obvious that the management is lacking.

Limited parking in front of the restaurant, so park in the hotel garage.\n\nAtmosphere: Casual and friendly. There's a nice dining room if you want a sit-down meal, a walk-up order counter inside for take-out orders, and a walk-up window outside if you don't feel like coming inside at all.\n \nCleanliness: No issues. The one time I sat down to a table in the dining room was very pleasant. \n\nService: The service inside and outside is great, but the walk-up window isn't open that late. When it's open it's fine, but it closes at midnight. Midnight? In Vegas? For a walk-up window? Don't they realize how many drunk tourists are out there stumbling around looking for a good slice of cheese at 3am? Sadly, they have lost my business more than a few times for closing early.\n\nFood/Drinks: I've been here four times so far and have ordered a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni from the counter and from the outside window, and I've had a whole pepperoni pie inside in the dining room. Good stuff. They even have a gluten free crust available, but if I'm going to cheat and eat pizza, I'm going balls to the wall and getting the good stuff. Speaking of good stuff, the Chianti they serve is really nice. \n\nHappy Hour: I haven't been lucky enough to hit it at the right time, but they have a Happy Hour 3-5-7 Menu. Monday-Friday 3pm-6pm and late night 10pm to close. Draft beers $3-$5 and wines by the glass $2 off. Several snacky size appetizers for $3, $5, or $7. Probably worth trying if you're in the area.\n\nPrice: $4 for a slice of cheese, $4.50 for pepperoni. Totally reasonable for such delicious cheesy goodness, especially in Vegas. Full menu available for inside dining, but let's be honest, 99% of the time you just want a quick, hot, delicious slice of cheese to go.

When we received the menu we were sort of confused only because we couldn't  understand the order sheet since it was all in Chinese :-| but after further investigation I deciphered the menu and realized you just match the number from the menu to the order sheet. Service was good no complaints, food was delivered fast and hot, still want to try the steam pork buns if they have them after all they are my favourite! The price wasn't to bad either..

My friend and I settled on splitting two sandwiches - the pulled pork and sausage link, both covered in Cincy chili. Cincinnati chili is a different style (and IMO, superior style) than Texas chili. Don't expect a lot of heat ... instead spices like cinnamon round out the flavor profile. I prefer my Cincy a bit on the sweeter and spicier side, but this was good chili, and complimented the pulled pork and sausage link well. The chili cheese fries side were awesome, and came at no extra charge. (99% of places offer fries as a side, and an upcharge to add the cheese and chili) Beans were good, but overshadowed by the awesomeness of the chili cheese fries.\n\nWe also ordered rib tips, but they were conspicuously absent from the meal. We checked with the server, who indicated that they were missed, and would be out soon. They were, and we were \"hooked up\" with a massive order. Being stuffed from the sandwiches and fries, we had room for about 2 rib tips each and then took them to go. They were wonderful, smoky, tender, and great then and as leftovers 3 hours later. \n\nTop Notch is another great example of the quality food you can find in Vegas when you know someone who is a local and you get off of The Strip and other touristy areas.

We walked over to the theater to reserve our seats around 10 that morning, but unfortunately forgot to bring the the vouchers. The young lady explained she needed the number on the voucher and she couldn't reserve seats without it, that is fine. It's my fault I forgot the tickets. She told me to check back throughout the day to see how seats are selling to give us an idea of when to come back to get tickets. \n\nWe were in the hotel room a few hours later to call and ask if they could possibly reserve over the phone since I have the voucher in front of me as well as to check the seating availability. The man I was speaking to was VERY rude. He asked what kid of ticket I purchased and I told him the young lady who helped me earlier said to use the term \"voucher\", so I did. His response was \"well, there are like 10 thousand different types of vouchers\". I was pretty shocked at his demeanor. I asked how sold out the show was and he said there was still plenty of general seating. A friend in our group decided to head down to get seats and when he got there he was told \"you're lucky you came now, you got the last seats in the house\". How is that possible?!?! 10 minutes prior the guy told us there were still plenty of seats!\n\nWhen we get to the show, which is up a few flights of stairs in the theater, so be prepared to that hike, we are shown to our seats, which are in the last row in the back. No problem, we were prepared for that and the theater is quite tiny. The worst part of the show was, without a doubt, the VERY loudly speaking crew in the box directly behind us!

I didn't return until women and trans hours were implemented a couple of years ago and since then I've only had really positive experiences.\n\nI really think that having the women/trans only space is just the thing to turn this place around and make the space/community more accessible to everyone.

Moly.  I have found my absolute new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  My meal on Saturday night was probably the best meal I have ever had at a restaurant.  We had 8:30pm reservations and made the trek over just in time for dinner.  It is on the corner of a main drag in Mt Lebo and is super cozy and intimate when you walk in. Bobby and I agreed that Bistro has an excellent use of space and albeit sitting close to other diners, it didn't feel uncomfortable or too packed at any time - and most every table was full during our visit.\n\nWe started with the house pinot grigio and a jack on the rocks and after our bread & butter arrived, so did our lemon pepper calamari appetizer.  The bread was warm and fresh and the butter was soooo good.  The calamari was perfectly cooked, lightly breaded and served in a portion large enough for 4 or more people to share.\n\nBobby ordered the crab cakes (served with garlic mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked carrots) and I ordered the almond chicken (served with a risotto and cooked spinach).  Portions were extremely generous - enough to eat half and take the other half home to eat later. Everything was absolutely delicious.  I noticed that while at most restaurants, food comes out warm, but here, our food came out piping hot. The crab cakes were huge and with lumps of tender crab and the mashed potatoes garlicky, and carrots perfectly cooked and flavorful.  My chicken was tender and juicy and the risotto was cheesy and amazing with garlic butter spinach that was not too bland or mushy.\n\nOur service was good, our waitress attentive and friendly.  The desserts at the table next to us looked good, but we were too full to try.  I had high expectations based on the photos other reviewers have posted here, and they were exceeded in both presentation and flavor of the food we had Saturday night.  I would totally love to try every entr\u00e9e and appetizer on the menu and I've already said I want to come back for my birthday in April.

I love it so I rate it very highly. And after a recent bad experience at a competitor's Mexican restaurant I decided to try Paco's Tacos for the first time. \n\nI came here on a Thursday night around 8 with my husband and a friend. It was pretty busy, but we got seated right away. Our server greeted us with water, chips and salsa. The salsa was great. It wasn't chunky (my husband isn't a fan of tomatoes) and had the right amount of spice. The chips were light and crispy. They tasted homemade. They were too good I couldn't stop eating them. \n\nI ordered the two taco combo, which came with rice, slaw and beans. All for only $11 (they are full size tacos too!)  I got the charro beans. It reminded me of baked beans and was something different from your typical black or refried beans. For my tacos, I mixed and matched. The shrimp taco was my favorite. The chipotle ranch sauce was on point and there was TONS of shrimp on it!! There had to be at least 10 pieces. I also got the turkey carnitas. The turkey was moist and not dry. I would recommend the shrimp instead. My husband got the Paco's taco (beef brisket), which was my second fav. \n\nOverall good vibes at Paco's tacos. I would highly recommend it to anyone and I will be back soon! \n\nPs try the slaw with your rice.

This trail is a fun 5 mile round trip through 5 train tunnels.  It starts off at the parking lot right before the Boulder city side Lake Mead entrance.  Not too far from the Hoover Dam.  You end up going on an easy flat gravel trail.  It is a very wide path the whole way, because this used to be the railroad for trains coming in & out to deposit materials and equipment during the building of the Boulder-'er I mean Hoover Dam.  You can see various deposits of the traces of history along the trail.  \n\nOn one point you will see some huge concrete disks that were dumped over.  Those disks were used as spacers to fit the original turbines into the dam.  Towards the later tunnels you will see where they just chucked the old wooden railroad ties over the side.  Probably during the switch from defunct train tracks to a public trail?  Either way the history is there to witness.  Some of the tunnels have some replicated wooden ceiling struts.  Apparently there was a fire years ago that burned the original struts down.  \n\nWhen you traverse along the trail you will see on 1 side the beautifully tragic ring of white rock showing the decline of Pond Mead's water elevation.  No matter the sparkling blue water still makes it a wonderful trip.  I remember ripping through the lake in our boat 10 years ago over much of the islands you now see in the center right by Calville Bay.  On the other side is a very picturesque scene of different geographic minerals.  Sandstone, basalt etc. The color variation makes for pleasant viewing along the mountain side of the trail.  \n\nStrollers with inflatable wheels and bikes are easily accessible throughout the trail.  We take our boys through on our double stroller every time.  Once you round the corner, the first of 5 tunnels is basically hiding right there.  The temps are nice inside them.  You spot benches about every 1/4 of the trail, for those who would need to take multiple breaks.  Once you get to the end of the 5th tunnel there is a gate that leads to the security check point area of the Hoover Dam.  If you are up for it you could continue walking all the way up to the Dam from there.  This might actually be the easiest hike in Clark County.\n\nIt's a very easy and doable total distance, well maintained and accommodating for all walks of life.  Filled with history, geographic scenery and sprawling views of Lake Mead with extended trekking possibilities.  I would have to say this is one of the must hit hikes for those looking to start off.

Anyway, I'd heard about Mandarin but didn't really care to pay as much as they want for weekend dinner when I'm usually available. Today it happened that I was free on a weekday at lunch time so I thought I'd give it a go.\n\nThe first thing that struck me about the place was the awesome service. I was greeted as soon as I walked in. The hostess who seated me asked if it was my first time and showed me where everything was. My server introduced herself by name and told me to ask if I needed anything at all. Drinks were refilled within seconds and plates were removed so fast I never even noticed it happening. A++.\n\nThe food was hit and miss but that's what I expect from a buffet. Being my first time I tried about two bites of every single thing I could find so I'll know what to get next time. All of the fried noodle dishes as well as the fried rice were absolutely void of flavour. They will be skipped next time. Pizza was close to what I make at hope. Was ok but will also be skipped because I can make it myself. Curry chicken was ok. Too much tumeric, though. I dislike being able to taste it, should be used just to color in my opinion. Roast salmon was delicious. Spicy chicken was the best thing I tasted. Lemon chicken was good, not overpowering on the artificial lemon extract like some places. The sauteed beans were also a surprise hit of awesomeness. Egg rolls and spring rolls were both disgusting. The sushi was nice. When I have a free weekday lunch I usually do all you can eat sushi so it was a welcome treat. It was the same as average budget sushi is everywhere else so no major complaints other than the yam maki not being tempura-crispy. The avacado peach maki and the chicken teriyaki maki hit the spot for me. Back to tempura, the vegetables stayed surprisingly crisp on the buffet. I approve. Chicken balls were what I'm used to from the east coast and I haven't seen those since moving to Toronto so I was tickled about that. \n\nDessert deserves it's own section because it made my heart sad. When I walked in I wanted to skip the hot stuff and just eat dessert. I'm glad I resisted temptation because it sucked. The sugar-free cheesecake didn't seem to have artificial sweetener either. The carrot cake was at least a week old. The creme caramel was a little curdled. Thankfully the rocky road square was perfect. Also the red velvet cheesecake ice cream was tasty. \n\nWith drink and the ridiculous amount of food listed above it rang in at 17.49. Excellent value considering it's 9 PM and I still haven't needed to eat again. I will definitely go back to Mandarin for lunch.

We went in around 8 PM on a Thursday, excited to get some of our favorite burgers in Cleveland again. The new location is quite nice and has a great ambiance, the open garage door allows for a nice breeze and lets you look out on to Lee Road. I'm sure it will be much nicer once construction finishes on Lee. We were rapidly seated and handed menus. \n\nWe ordered the corn appetizer and asked for some waters initially. The appetizer came out in a fair amount of time, they were exceptional in flavor. However we were served the appetizer without any small plates or cutlery; we requested some plates and cutlery and were brought plates but again no cutlery. So we resorted to eating it with our hands. Flavor and seasoning were spectacular thus far, but the service left something to be desired.\n\nPrior to the appetizer coming out we had both ordered the Hibachi burgers done medium, and requested the fries extra crispy as we've always had issues with the fries from Black Box being rather floppy. We waited what felt like an exceptionally long time for our burgers to come out, and ultimately they came out. What followed was one of the more disappointing meals I've experienced, especially for a burger I've had before and loved in the past. The burger and fries were cold, so much so that the parmesan cheese that was placed on top of the fries didn't even soften. The burger that we requested done medium was clearly done rare and quite pink in the center. The patty and shrimp on the burger as well as the bun were cold. The worst part was that fries, which we had requested extra crispy, were still rather flaccid. \n\nFor desert we ordered the Pineapple Express Cake, which was pretty much a pile of whipped creme in a pie crust with a canned pineapple ring on it. I'll take fault for this as I should have read the description on the menu where it stated it was whipped creme. To be fair though, it shouldn't be called a cake. We requested our checks, after handing us our check the waitress stood over our shoulders watching and waiting for us to tip which felt quite awkward. \n\nOverall it took my roommate and I slightly under 2 hours to get a burger and fries, which came out cold. The flavors were there and taste was good, the high quality of the ingredients being used was evident,  and the ambience was great. The service left quite a lot to be desired. \n\nI give any new restaurant two chances before I write it off so I will visit again in a few weeks just incase the events of my first visit were due to them being newly opened.

I get the top tier unlimited service, it's a business expense, and I had the Cobblestone pass for the past year and a half.  The quality at the Cobblestone locations in Mesa, Gilbert and Scottsdale were good but not great and I noticed as they aged and gained more unlimited pass customers the quality and attention to detail dropped off significantly.\n\nLooking for a change I gave Jacksons a try which offered a better wash deal for what I was paying for at Cobblestone.  Their VIP package includes carnuba wax, triple foam conditioner, tire dressing and dash/door dressing.  Cobblestone, for the same price, did not include wax (really?) just the triple foam conditioner and did not include the dash/door dressing.  So for the same price I am getting more services and from what I am seeing, better quality and attention to detail.\n\nEveryone at Jacksons has been super friendly, helpful and they work hard to take care of your ride to make it look its best.\n\nResults will vary depending on how often you wash your car, the more frequently you wash/wax the better it will look. It's like brushing your teeth, the more consistently you do it the better it works.  Don't expect a miracle if you neglect and wash/wax infrequently.\n\nIn AZ with all the dust and pollution in the valley I would recommend weekly washes and at a maximum bi-weekly.  I go more frequently (2-3X a week) because I am putting a lot of miles and dust on it during the week.  Exterior detail once to twice a year minimum for normal driving, 3X for more heavy driving.  My VIP SUV is over 3 years old and close to $150k miles and the paint still looks like glass and I get a lot of complements from customers.\n\nI highly recommend giving Jacksons a try, I have been very pleased so far.

I did buy the car at this location as well.  They emailed me to let me know in advance that it was time for my first service.  I showed up on time for my appointment, and they took my car right away.  As it was a basic checkup, they estimated 45 minutes.  I had a hunch it was going to take longer -- which they told me it would, after I said that I do want my car washed -- so I did get the loaner.  They had one ready for me right away.  The service ended up taking almost exactly 2 hours, which is a little bit long.  However, when they returned my car to me, they told me there was a small nail in the back tire.  The service manager said that he did not want to charge me for a whole new expensive Lexus tire and advised me to go to somewhere like Discount Tire to get it patched, which I REALLY appreciated.\n\nFollow-up to this:  I took my car to Discount Tire, and while it was there, they couldn't get the tire off because a repair shop had kept my tire lock key.  When I called Lexus of Chandler to make sure they didn't have it, the service coordinator called me back to tell me that A) their people use their own set of keys, and B) they didn't rotate my tires because it's not possible on an F Sport (which was news to me, by the way).  Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a second follow-up call from the service coordinator, telling me that no matter where I go to buy a replacement tire lock key, to call her and tell her the amount, and she will apply that exact amount to a future credit for any service at Lexus of Chandler.  \n\nI want to also mention that my original buying experience when I bought the new Lexus was great... if a bit long.  (And I was wearing \"errand clothes,\" by the way -- as I had stopped by the dealership on a whim \"just to look\"-- they treated me just fine.)

Their credit card system was a mess (\"West End Parking $800+\" was a big red flag to the credit card company), and this debacle was repeated during checkout. During the harrowing process of check in, the smug manager thought it pertinent to extol the virtues of their amenities, linens, and beds. All of which were standard issue hotel kinds of things, nothing special, and he only flittered away once there appeared to be an issue with the check in process. And that \"Sky View Room\" he said I would love? Glad I didn't care about that...a huge long curtained wall with a sliver of a window. Nice to have that curtain there to protect their guest's privacy from those with the ability to see through walls.\n\n-No hot water. I stayed four nights and not until the afternoon I checked out did I ever have hot water.\n\n-The maid service folded up used/damp towels and mixed them in with the clean ones. I requested new towels twice by phone, only to end up going down stairs myself to get clean ones.\n\n-I've never had a problem with excessive noise from closing doors in a hotel, but leave it to Westin. The doors slam and shake the walls, waking even the most sound sleeper.\n\n-Roomservice did not once get an order right, nor was the food warmer than room temperature, and the food itself was abysmal. After a 12-15hr workday, a simple sandwich would suffice and their menu was completely lacking. The only bright spot was Glen who was helpful in making one of my orders correct, and stood out head and shoulders above the rest of the staff.\n\n-The refrigerator in the room never worked. After reporting it multiple times, I just gave up on having cold water.\n\n-Their business center was filthy. They had hosted a wedding in the hotel the night I used it and never bothered to clean up the spilled drinks and garbage from the reception.\n\nAnd these are just the things I happen to remember, I'm sure there are more. Other guests I ran into in the lobby, on the elevators, and at our conference, had the same things to say.\n\nCleveland is a wonderful city, with an incredibly hospitable community.

The facilities are clean and very well maintained.  Housekeeping staff is fantastic also.  They were not intrusive and they were hospitable.  \n\nHowever, the ONE thing that bothered me was the reception staff.  I was mistreated.  I say this because I asked the reception staff a question about the pool hours and the response I received was \"Are you a guest here?\"  Followed by \"because we get a lot of people around here...\"  While that response is completely understandable, I must point out that I checked in an hour earlier with the SAME staff at the desk.  This may be me sounding like a self-centered, remember me-type of person, but no.  I felt that the receptionist was categorizing me because of my age and because of my look.  I guess I just look like the type that would crash into a hotel pool?  Mind you, this Residence Inn is adjacent to the Mayo Clinic and desert land.  Yes, the only two things around walking distance are this hotel and the hospital.  So apparently, this hotel pool must be the hot spot for pool crashers.  Must be all the sickly patients that want to take a dip in the pool.  \n\nThen on the same occasion, the same reception staff told me that they did not have a bottle opener at the desk.  There is a small convenient store next to the reception desk that sells wine, beer, water, soda, snacks, etc.  I purchased a beer and asked them if they had a bottle opener so I could drink my beer by the fire pits and they said no.  It had been misplaced.  Some time later, the nice gentleman that helped me open my beer got beers at the reception desk and somehow, they magically had a bottle opener.  Strange how they had one for him, but not for me. \n\nRegardless, I was a bit bummed that the reception staff was childish and rude to me.  I felt like I was individually singled out to be discriminated against.  It's a shame too because I love my Marriott Rewards card.  \n\nThe rooms are large here.  The elevator takes forever!

Unfortunately, it was disappointing from the beginning to the end.  I made a reservation for a group of 11 about two weeks before the dinner.  The day of, I called several hours before to decrease the reservation from 11 people to 7 people.  The girl on the phone was very confused about what I wanted to do and after a long awkward pause and an uncomfortable phone conversation, I felt like MAYBE we had the reservation I wanted.  Upon arrival, we let the hostess know we were there and after clearing up that we were a party of 7 for a 6pm reservation, NOT a party of 6 for a 7pm reservation, we finally had a seat.\n\nThe server that greeted our table was friendly and cheerful, but upon request of splitting the check into 3 parties said they were unable to do 3 checks but could accomodate 2 checks.  We requested two checks.  We ordered our food, and after 45 minutes waiting with no bread or any sort of thing to nibble on, our food finally arrived.  It was mediocre at best.  The best item was the fried chicken.  Very flavorful and not dry or overly greasy.  I had the Brisket Sandwich which was very scant with the meat and very overbearing with the bread.  The piece of brisket was about the size of an extra thick piece of bacon plus a few milimeters served on a huge, bready hoagie roll.  The bread was all you could taste and the meat was totally lost.  Even after taking the sliver of meat off the bun and eating it, with both of the sauces available on the table, I was less than impressed.  The strength of a BBQ place is in its meats and if you slack in the meat department, no matter how good your Mac and Cheese is you're not going to succeed.  The mac and cheese was good, not amazing.  The cornbread was super dry on the edges and bland.  No butter served with the cornbread either which I thought was super weird.  The have two sauces available on the table, one a thick more traditional BBQ sauce and one a chili infused vinegar sauce.  The thicker sauce was no more memorable than the Kraft variety at the grocery store, and the vinegar was nothing remarkable as well.  We ended the meal with whoopie pies, a chocolate one filled with marshmallow icing and a salted caramel one.  I only tried the chocolate one which was decent, a little dry, but the icing was nice and creamy and not overly sweet.\n\nThey do have a nice beer selection, and actually had a good special of $3 bottles of Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold the day we were there. I'll get more into that later...\n\nWhen the check arrived, the two checks were actually just one check.  After attempting to divide the check between the three parties, it was noted that the beers were not charged as $3 but as $5 each.  Our waitress was nowhere to be found, so another waitress was able to correct this.  She said they had been charging that price all day and no one had noticed it.  Good thing to know...  We then had to divide our check up again amongst three parties, now with the correct pricing.  Upon complaining to the waitress that they should be able to split checks since it accounts for tax and the 20% gratuity that had been automatically added, she said it gets too complicated and even if three people walk in, checks are never split amongst those three people.  I'm sorry but in this day and age, restaurants have great computer systems and I've been places where 25 people get 25 checks.  It just leaves a bad taste in the patron's mouth to end the meal with a calculator and a stack of bills or credit cards.\n\nThe decor was picnic which was cute for a BBQ place with high ceilings, but the amount of echo was incredible. The place was about half full and was so loud you couldn't talk to someone unless they were right next to you.  Oh and the front window is broken with a piece of wood covering it.  Seems like it's going to be there a while too since they've actually painted a design on the front of it.\n\nLong story short...totally overrated, overpriced BBQ with a difficult setup if you plan on bringing a group of people.", "useful": 6, "cool": 2, "user_id": "D5YwD8rMx3f8gUFDp4JeSA", "review_id": "XHA9T3TQ0ZibmAi-mzhihw"}, {"date": "2016-03-16", "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "business_id": "D_X8kdLisgAD2ZdCsw4NMw", "text": "I've broken my iPhone screen a few times and each fix they've done took only a few hours and was done well.

I was so excited that called the very next day to make my appointment 2 weeks in advance ( once a year I straighten hair) so I was really excited. I usually go to so kinky so curly so straight salon on mayfield rd. \n\nSo on the day of my appointment which was at about 9am I walk in and I was very impressed with the lime green and black decor. So I have a seat and I wait and I wait and I wait until this lady comes out and I smile because finally I'm about to be seen. Not! She decides to make herself some coffee and walk back into the salon area. Wait, what?! Excuse me bitch for thinking my hair and excellent customer service came first before your precious cup of coffee. \n\nNow I'm pissed and want to leave but I really want my hair done. So finally she comes back and ask me who I'm waiting for, I tell her mind you I did make an appointment ( I wish I could remember her name if I had a list I could tell you, but she's light skin and she looks mixed at the time her hair was long and blond) and I'm brought back and let me tell you what happened:\n\nThis person who claims to be a professional, looks at my hair in disgust, like wtf am I suppose to do with that? And while I'm standing with my coat on yanks at my hair without warning. Then she says, \"you can hang your coat up over there\", how rude. So I'm doing the walk of shame now because I already know what's about to happen. \n\nMy previous hair style that I was wearing at the time was a Afro puff and my edges gelled down. This bimbo decides that she would take a hot ass flat iron to my hair, gel and all. Then she tells me that my hair is virgin hair and that it has never been straighten before and that my ends are so damaged that she would have to cut my chin length hair to my ears and the charge would be $80. $&}%\u0080**\u00a3\u00a5? Is you crazy? You better get cho life! Then she ask me am I'm ok with that I told her no and she handed me her card and told me to make an appointment when I was okay with that. I said thank you and left and as soon as I hit that door I tossed her card to the wind.\n\n\nReally, how dare you treat a customer like that. You could imagine how I felt being told that basically my hair was too nappy just off a glance. My hair was not washed or conditioned and I had gel build up so of course it looked a little crazy. She didn't even try. How can u call yourself a professional that claims to do natural hair? If you decide for a year that you don't want a perm and you constantly get your hair pressed without getting your ends clipped I am sorry, you are not natural and you won't be until your ends are clipped and clear of all permed hair. And that's the type of (\"natural\" I think they are use to). They should specify that they only do natural hair textures A-1C. \n\nOverall the place is nice and pretty to look at but the workers are rude and ghetto and the conversation that they where having at the time was inappropriate for a work environment.

I like the vibe immediately, the layout of the bar vs. the dining areas, and the urbane feel of the place. I had no difficulty finding something good for dinner, with the ample choices of appetizers, flat breads, burgers and sandwiches. Good beer and wine choices to accompany them, too. I opted for the rib-sticking entree choice of pan-fried walleye, while my dining companions chose flat breads and the gumbo (or was it jumbalaya?) At any rate, smiles and full tummies all around. My two filets of walleye were served with mashed potatoes and green beans, both very fresh and well-executed.

This place had great reviews and was reasonably priced, plus in the pictures it didn't look like a chop shop, clearly I was wrong. I got there right at 11am when my appointment was scheduled but was asked if I could wait 10 min as they were running behind and I said that's fine. At 11:15 Nina (I think that was her name) took me back and began removing my acrylics. Now the WORST way to remove acrylics is for them to take another fake nail and pry the acrylic from your natural nail, I know this because I've worked in high end salons for the past 3 years (and the reason I did not go to my salon was because there was no time available when I could go). I saw Nina pull out the box of fake nails and I said \"Are you going to soak my nails in acetone first, I have sensitive nails and it hurts when you pry them off.\" She said she was going to try prying them off anyway and if it hurts she will soak....okay so she started to pry and I said \"yes that hurts.\" Her reply was \"I can soak your nails but I doubt I'll have time to do a manicure cuz then I'll run late in my next appointment.\" Here's where I'm confused. When I booked my appointment they sent me an email to confirm saying \"11am acrylic removal and 11:30am manicure\" that means the removal should take 30 minutes which is how long it takes if you soak them. To pry off my acrylics and not soak them that would take maybe 10 minutes. So I was already booked for the full time to properly remove them so why would my time run over? She told me if she doesn't have time for my manicure someone else will do it which was fine with me. While my nails are soaking she's walking around the salon, slouching, looking like I'm wasting her time. While she's doing my nails she proceeds to tell me \"next time don't get acrylic get gels it's better\" I said \"no I like acrylic I'm just taking a break before I get them again\". When she does my manicure it's so sloppy, she's taking way too much polish and it just looked a mess. And she finished me 15 minutes early so it took her only 45 minutes to rush through my appointment. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because I want to come back and see Kim for my acrylics because everyone speaks so highly of her.

The food was OK, not great, and the chef did a nice job with the grill entertainment.\n\nAside from that, this place is awful.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how empty it was at 6:30 p.m. on a Thursday. That should have been my first clue. Then, I couldn't help but  notice how dirty the place was overall. My feet were sticking to the floor as I walked to our table and once I sat down my shoes were almost glued to the floor. \n\nOur server was pretty bad...and that's being kind. \n\nMy 13-year old son ordered a California roll for dinner. My 10, soon to be 11-year old daughter ordered the Pokemon (chicken/shrimp Hibachi). My wife had the pineapple chicken hibachi and I had a chicken stir fry hibachi.\n\nAgain, the Hibachi was fine. The egg rolls we ordered could have been frozen and microwaved and the soup was pretty gross.\n\nI had planned to be very stingy on my tip due to our server's lack of attention to our table. With no other tables--I'm not exaggerating, we were the only group in the hibachi side of the restaurant--our server should have checked on us, at least to refill our drinks.\n\nI was shocked when I received the bill to see 18-percent gratuity already added, which pushed our dinner total for four (two adults and two kids) to $91.50. \n\nSeriously? 18-percent gratuity? No wonder our server seemed careless. He was. He already was getting 18-percent, why work harder?\n\nOur purpose for visiting the Hibachi was to celebrate my daughter's birthday. It was her choice. She wanted the sparkler cake dessert. Unfortunately, this Hibachi didn't have it. They did have a cheesecake my kids were excited about, but apparently the restaurant was out. They settled for sherbert, which might have been in the freezer since the day the place opened.

I was contacted back within 30 minutes of the shop's opening and was able to make an appointment for both my friend and myself.  Walk-ins are also welcome, but I would suggest making an appointment.  There is an $80 minimum on all tattoos, which is standard at most shops.  My piece is about 4\"x3\" and was very reasonably priced.\n\nI was tattooed by Captain Dave, who had a no-nonsense approach to his work.  As he began working on my piece, he got more friendly and put me at ease.  I could not be more pleased with my piece, which is very detailed--a black and grey shade elephant on my shoulder.  Dave surprised me by being expedient while maintaining highly intricate design details like the wrinkles and hairs--even on the elephant's trunk and tail.\n\nVery, very impressed with the cleanliness, professionalism and quality of the ink work at Studio 21 Tattoo.

This is their first venture across the state line in NC. The restaurant in located in downtown Pineville near the railroad tracks.\n\nThis is a different concept than their other two restaurants. This is of the fast casual variety. You order at the counter of a list of grinders (pressed sandwiches), salads and sides and daily specials. You get a number, grab your drink and find a table and wait for your order.\n\nI had the meatball grinder an a side caesar salad. The meatballs in the grinder were very savory and the sauce was great as well. I was eating that with my fork. The bread was good but I didn't think this idea worked well as a pressed sandwich. By the time my sandwich arrived the bread was mostly broken already so the meatballs didn't stay in the sandwich. The salad was good though.\n\nMy coworker had one of their weekly specials, a pulled pork sandwich topped with mac n cheese that he thought was great but not as good as items we've had at their Fort Mill location.\n\nHowever, this is a new concept for Flipside.

I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she said she could do it, designs and all. I even asked 2 times if she was able to do it in matte. \n\nIt started off so well. The conversations were consistent, and the pedicure was relaxing given the long day at work I just had. My friend came in with me so it was just a great vibe altogether. My nail lady - for lack of better term - was making effort to converse and had such a sweet energy to her.\n\nCome time for the manicure, the color that I had requested was different.... i was aiming for a matte deep burgundy with a black matte accenting ring finger. The matte polish ran out as she was in the middle of the second coat, but did not bother saying anything until I did! It looked way too clumpy and bubbly. Scratches were visible! I let her know.\n\nShe then started speaking in her language to a younger lady, who suggested to do it the old school way. Nail lady resumes but started rolling her eyes at the lady she was just speaking to. Not only did she struggle doing the matte, but she then tells me that she cant do the design i wanted! Mind you, i confirmed with her PRIOR to making the appointment!\n\nRidiculous. A whopping 94.00 for a pedicure and 2 gel manicures for a half-assed job. Then had the audacity to say \"im not going to charge you for matte cuz its your birthday.\" You mean you're not going to charge me for matte cuz it ran out on me!!!!!\n\nDont bother wasting your time here.

Redline has a CR65 license which is for window glazing.  The license should be CR67 for alarm companies.  Don't make the mistake I did - always check.  You can confirm this on the Arizona Registrar of Contractors web site.\n\nI live rather remotely but Redline said no problem and came out and installed my system.  This included 4 security cameras tied to the system as well as glass break and other sensors.  This equated to SEVERAL THOUSANDS of dollars.  With the first rain storm two cameras went out.  They came back and replaced them.  The rep said they have these systems all over and never have this type of problem with them.  My husband, who is a general contractor, looked at their installation.  It was not even water proofed.  The cameras are on the roof of the house.\n\nNow it is a little over a year and another camera goes out.  Monitronics sends their teck out to determine what the problem was.  I was told the camera was no good.  Welll of course they are now out of warranty.  I contacted Redline and they said the type of cameras I have are no longer being used but he did get a replacement camera from Alarm.com.  Now I need it connected and learned in to the system.  Monitronics first said they would schedule someone but then called back and said they no longer have anyone that services our area.  What about Redline who sold it to me??  They no longer service my area either.  Well just take the money and run I guess is their motto.  Then Monitronics calls and says they have to terminate my system because they can't service me.  Mind you I had to sign a two year contract but I guess that doesn't count.  \n\nMy husband had several conversations with the Arizona Registrar of Contractors as well as the rep from Redline.  The Registrar of Contractors confirmed that Redline is operating 'out of scope' with the license they have.  Redline said they would help get us up and running with a new service provider as well as providing  monetary help for the inconvenience.  We found a company that would service us from Wickenburg - who does have the correct license.  Redline never came through with any help after we made arrangements with the company from Wickenburg.

Excellent but limited wine list, local beers from Toronto were a nice touch. We had the smoked salmon board, in my opinion - toast was too thick to pair with fresh smoked salmon. The salmon itself was nice - it was served with capers, onions and fresh parsley. Would have enjoyed it more if it was served with thin sliced baked baguette.

She verified with the person on the phone that we'd get 2 queen beds because on the website it says they only have suites with a king bed. My friend gets there, checks in and of course there aren't any rooms with 2 queen beds. The good thing is after complaining we got a roll away cot that was actually pretty comfortable. \n\nBeing such a new hotel, I think the staff is slightly inexperienced. My friend had added my name to the room because I was arriving at a different time and at first the person at the front desk couldn't find my name on the reservation and after a minute or so was like oh I looked in the wrong place... uhhhh ok? Then when directing us to the elevator to get to our room, we got the wrong directions and ended up somewhere else... \n\nThe location is only ok. It's all the way at the end of the strip so it's not as easy to get around but if the weather isn't bad, that's not too much of an issue.  It is close enough to TI, Wynn and Venetian that if you usually only stay around that area than it's no biggie.  Also it's right across from this large mall so there is plenty of shopping. \n\nOk so the good... \n\nThe room is really nice and up to what I expected. It was nice to have the drapes open and close right by the bedside. The bathroom is great and being a new hotel, you can tell the towels, sheets etc. are all crisp and clean. \n\nA big plus was that we had left our curling iron on in the room. We called the hotel and they helped us go into the room and turn it off.  I know it benefits them more than me because if their hotel burnt down after opening for 3 weeks would be a disaster but it was still nice of them to do it.  So overall the staff is very friendly and they try to be helpful.\n\nChecking out was also very easy.  As soon as we came down the elevators, they had 2 people waiting to check your name off and that was it. Check out down.  Fast and easy.  We didn't have to return any keys because they print your name on them which I thought was kind of cool.\n\nAnd other random comments... \nSo this hotel is definitely geared towards an Asian clientele (and more specifically chinese) because the red from the hotel was overwhelming. Also floor 40-49 is missing. \n\nThe casino seemed kind of empty for a vegas hotel. During the day, the bj tables were around $10 even though it was Sat. At night I think you could find tables for $15.", "useful": 2, "cool": 1, "user_id": "ru2kRABO1QvBhfYXb2AbtA", "review_id": "IY1Iu-3VhXgtP9OtkeZ-ow"}, {"date": "2013-04-03", "stars": 4, "funny": 0, "business_id": "FQB3VXrWYM_m_XrzwRozAg", "text": "From reading the other reviews it seems like a hit or miss sometimes. I've been here twice and liked it.  Service was decent on refilling drinks and even replacing the grill for a new one. It is a bit pricier than the other AYCE korean BBQs, around $25 for dinner. It is a bit cheaper for lunch, but there is no tri-tip steak then, which is one of the meats I love to BBQ.\nI will say I didn't diverge far from mostly eating meat and making lettuce wraps with it. Usually for korean bbq, you dip the cooked meat in sesame oil that has some salt in it. Put it into a green leaf lettuce with a little rice and bean or chili paste and wrap it and consume. FYI. it's fun to try to eat each wrap in one bite!\nI did have a few side vegetables. I will agree with my sister that the soups did look questionable, don't know if they just sat out too long or just were flat out bad but it's not something I was going to sample anyways. I did not even go for their sushi. I'm there to eat alot of meat, if I was craving sushi I'd go to a sushi restaurant lol. I mostly raided their tri-tip, spicy pork & brisket. peppered with a little tongue in between. Dip the meats cept the pork, in sesame oil seasoned with salt, make it a lettuce wrap with a bit of rice and bean paste and I am set.\nMaybe I've been fortunate on my visits by eating only certain things or catching the servers on their good nights but so far it's been good.", "useful": 1, "cool": 2, "user_id": "zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg", "review_id": "QnHPcOS_TiYGSjO1FBF4-A"}, {"date": "2017-11-17", "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "business_id": "4Pn83EWDr16n6kU1O6u42g", "text": "Fantastic all around!

Everytime it would turn on and off (since I put it on auto), it would go off soooooo loud that me and my boyfriend would wake up in the middle of the night. We were super tired throughout the whole stay.\n\nI called the front desk to complain and the employee's attitude was super rude. I complained that I couldnt sleep because of construction noise and all she said was there is nothing she can do. Though, I didint book the hotel myself and I didnt see anything on their website, she just told me everything was stated on the website and it was my fault for not reading it completely. It was such a rude comment to make for an employee. This is purely service job and obviously she is so unprofessional. Not only that, I called later to get a bottle opener and possibly some silverware, another staff member who answered my phone straight up told me NO because room service is closed (it was 8 pm). So I asked her again theres nothing you can do for me? And she responded NO and hung up on me.

Fabbrica showed up on my yelp as a potential and had early reservations opening on OpenTable.  I quickly booked my table and off we went.  Parking was super easy in the parkade and wasn't too busy for a Sunday early evening.  Though we arrived before a normal dinner time and the light shown into the whole place, you can tell it would be a nice atmosphere at night with it's trendy woods, modern atmosphere, and comfortable seating.  It would not be out of place to see this restaurant in downtown Toronto... the only difference is that Fabbrica actually has space between the tables!\n\nThe hostess was perfectly friendly and accommodated easily a request to be seated near a window.  We ended up getting a cozy 4 top that is secluded and separate from most of the dining area.  It's a nice table as it had leather comfortable chairs and the table top was actually stone.  The sun shone through a filtered screen and was a nice area.\n\nThe menu had a lot of variety and what did surprise me a bit was the price point.  It rivaled some of the downtown prices and yet here it was in DVP and Don Mills area.  I guess the Mark McEwan brand is a premium even in the middle of suburbia.  We ended up getting 2 non alcoholic drink (OJ for $5!! and a mint lemonade for $7), one main to split (salmon), 2 sides (fries and rapini), and 2 desserts (seasonal rhubarb pavlova and chocolate torte).  All this came up to nearly $100 ... thats right.  $100 for 1 adult and 1 small child.  Don't get me wrong, nothing was wrong with the food... it was good but for that price, I'm expecting creative food, top shelf ingredients, gorgeous plating, and top end service that I've had recently in Toronto.  It doesn't help I also went to argueably the best restaurant in TO the previous day (Grey Gardens... just mind blowing amazing).  \n\nThe service was good but relaxed and perfectly suitable for a low key enjoyable slow paced family meal.  It wasn't attentive and yet cool to fit a price point like this.  I really thought the service was thoughtful though as he did offer the little one to try the punch first before ordering a full sized.  I liked that.    \n\nI did like the food ... salmon was well cooked as it kept the translucent peachy middle.  Fries were generous with the cheese but not as crispy to be great.  The rapini was laughable small as it only maybe had 9 small branches for $10.  The bread offering was nice ... you don't see that too often.  The drinks and side prices are definitely more expensive than places in downtown Toronto.\n\nIf the meal came to $80 including tip... I would say it's more fair to be a solid 4 stars but sitting at $100, it just makes me question if it worth it and not try other places first.

Overall I enjoyed the stadium. They have open seating so fans can wonder around and try to sneak in open seats. The thrill of moving around is great, but the constant up and down makes viewing difficult. The weak screen they have doesn't much help. \n\nThey had good food at fairly reasonable prices ( 8.50 for chicken fingers and fries), but there are no TVs/speakers in  concession so keeping up with the game was difficult when the lines came to a standstill which they seemed to do constantly.\n\nGetting into the stadium was a nightmare. There were no clear lines, so people just stormed the gate. They had maybe six ticket scanners that were moving at senior citizen speed. They don't have a bag check, from my experience, and just wave a metal detector in front of you without much zeal. I wasn't checked at all and no one seemed to care that I just by passed that step. \n\nParking was fairly simply. Stadium parking is 25 bucks for the day and there are nearby garages for 10 bucks. This is of course an increase from the displayed 5 dollar daily parking for non-events, but such is life. \n\nGetting out of the stadium was just as disorganized as entering with people walking in the streets, cars at a dead halt and cops just monitoring to make sure the drunks were in line. \n\nMy final comment has to be reserved for the fans. I love spirited fans. When the Browns were doing well the place was truly electric--everyone yelling, on their feet, clapping--it was a true sight to behold. What I can't say I like is being called an asshole by about 100 people on my way in. I get it:I want you to lose, but shut the fuck up you lose all the time! And beyond that I don't know in what world it is okay for a grown man to scream in my face and call me a \"fucking asshole.\" \n\nHave some respect.

My first visit here was last March as a surprise for my fiancee's birthday, and I have returned here almost every few months since.\n\nI honestly don't get why so many people think Melting Pot is overpriced. On my most recent visit, the bill came to $125 bucks for a 4-course meal for two and 4 cocktails. The dining experience always takes at least an hour to an hour an a half for us, and that is with a constant fill of food, drinks, and fun. You're poking things with forks and putting them into a steaming pot...get a few of their strong and delicious cocktails in you, and it becomes pretty darn entertaining.\n\nThe food never disappoints. I'm sure the meat isn't the most high-end organic grass-fed fancy stuff some people expect, and the cheese isn't some kind of organic non-hormone laced experiment, but the food is tasty. I usually stick to the classics: cheddar fondue, the house salad (which don't forget to smother that baby with wine&garlic seasoning), and the classic meat entree. The cookies and cream fondue is by far the best dessert. Besides the food, the cocktails are some of the best I've had. The smores martini is the best offering, but the pear cocktail is also to die for. One of the best things about Melting Pot is if you run out of dippers for your cheese or chocolate, they'll happily bring more until you're satisfied.\n\nBesides the food and drink being awesome, the service is equally superb. The waiters are always friendly and talkative. They go beyond making small talk as they're preparing your food. The waiters know how to make jokes and be generally entertaining. This last time I visited, my waiter went out of his way to get the bartender to make me my favorite cocktail (which was not being offered on the menu at the time.) That's going above and beyond to make sure I was happy. The staff always makes sure to ask what occasion you're celebrating, and if it's a birthday or an anniversary, they will make sure the kitchen will write a message in chocolate on your dessert plate.\n\n5 stars all around!", "useful": 2, "cool": 0, "user_id": "bbfwZ-2Pf6hLgEBUNRNsvA", "review_id": "bZL1r5F-2v_tGRARPnes8A"}, {"date": "2016-07-26", "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "business_id": "sCtxuMqfHrcQvSNY1390eQ", "text": "Pros; ambiance, piano player, steak, mac and cheese\nCons; none \n\n\nGreat experience.

Ate it cause it was 57$ but was not completely satisfied since it wasn't cooked enough. \nThe steak was missing any kind of seasoning at all. Literally no salt, no pepper, nothing. I poured an ample amount of the demi glaze on it to add flavor, but there's only so much sauce u can pour before getting sick of it. \nThe potato pur\u00e9e was amazing but there was so little. And the vegetables it came with.... forget about it. 2 carrots and 2 celery root? Delicious but such a small amount.\n\n- Mac and cheese: was very good. The peas really make this dish a hit!!!!\n\n- peanut butter something: came with cacao nib ice cream, peanut butter mouse, candies peanuts, and a chocolate peanut butter bar... it was pretty good and quite the presentation.\n\nIf i would return here, it's only cause there was a couple other things I wanted to try. I'll stay away from the steak sadly. The cocktails, the bread, and the deserts!!! Yum. U can keep your flavorless steak.", "useful": 0, "cool": 0, "user_id": "SeEKl2xmuooLCIFNl3FUcw", "review_id": "QxCmqS9uhKpTOwb3REPoxA"}, {"date": "2016-12-07", "stars": 1, "funny": 0, "business_id": "148d7J-cFejkhYV89y3Jsg", "text": "Well before we even got on our ride the old hag working there (I didn't get her name) was extremely rude!

Similarly when we arrived the hostess was very nice and Eddie was at the hostess stand keeping vigilant watch on the ebb and flow of the seating and said hello.  Big plus.  Unfortunately it went way downhill when we sat down.  The menu was significantly more expensive than was posted online.  We brushed this off and committed ourselves to paying more as good food is worth it; however,  we sat for 10 minutes without any greeting from a server.

Caesar salad: very small, bland and overpriced.  I ordered a specialty drink which was made all wrong and undrinkable, so I pushed it to the edge  and asked for a wine list.  I was given one but was never given the opportunity to order a glass of wine.  Meanwhile oi lamb chops with mint hummus had arrived - yummy.  Unfortunately, one of my boufriend'a chops were blue raw. After several attempts to get the bartender's attention - I placed it at the edge of the bar on a plate with the blue side showing next to my untouched disgusting drink.  Our bartender (a female) never checked on us, never asked how our meal was - she was 3 -6 feet away almost the whole time!  Really???  Albeit she was busy on service bar, but only had 6 customers.  You know when someone is staring at you and needs something!  Finally, after 15-mins  I flagged down the other bartender (Danny who also happened to be the manager) , explained what had happened, and asked if he could cash us out so we could escape.  He graciously assisted us right away - while he was at the computer the bartender barked that she had already cancelled our order.
