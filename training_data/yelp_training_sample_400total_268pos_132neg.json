Reason being, this isn't their first restaurant opening. Globe has two other locations, so it's owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant. But rather than focus on the facts that it smelled like a construction site, the floors and walls needed some minor finishing work, the staff were wandering about looking slightly confused and a little scared, and the place generally seemed like it probably wasn't ready to open just yet, I'm going to put all that aside and focus on the rest of Globe.\n\nGlobe's focus is on local stuff; that means they try to only serve products that are made close-to-home. Trouble is, I'm not exactly sure how far that close-to-home boundary extends to. I was told that it includes Ontario as a whole, but it could also go much further East or West; their Albacore tuna, for example, comes from BC and their mussels come from PEI. Other items don't explicitly explain where they come from, like the Cornish hen. That's the difficulty with going local though; right-off-the-bat you need to firmly establish your local boundaries. BC and PEI, after all, aren't right around the corner. Why not Maine lobster? Maine is a lot closer and seems a lot more local to me than anywhere in BC.\n\nI suppose my beef here is that if you want to focus on locally produced stuff, then why not do it right down to the last detail? Why have a couple of wines from Italy and the US when you could easily make a wine menu completely from Niagara Peninsula wines or even from West Coast British Columbia (since we haven't yet established where that local line is drawn). I suppose the entire local concept is pretty hot right now, considering the whole farm-to-table trend, but those places are a bit more sincere by growing and sourcing everything onsite. To me, that's what true local eating is all about: setting firm boundaries.\n\nThe main thing that caught me right away-even more so than the local-ness of stuff-was the truly reasonable prices. At my initial walk-in to the beautiful dining room, I expected to pay a bit more, but that wasn't the case at all. Starters are around 11 bucks, entrees are around 22; at prices like that, it's even kind of refreshing, considering how elegant both the dining room and bar spaces are. And the food is good too. The local carnivore flatbread, for example, had a perfectly cooked flatbread base with some delicious, good-quality meats. The baked Spring vegetable tart seemed a little strange served on raw spinach, but the contrast worked nicely together.\n\nThe dining room space is beautiful. 20 foot ceilings, elegant lighting, solid wooden tables. In terms of sheer ambience and sophistication, there's nothing in Bloor West Village that can even come close to competing with Globe.\n\nDespite the wandering servers, we were lucky enough to have the only one that seemed focused. Even though the meddling manager kept needlessly hovering over us mere seconds each time before our server got there, we had fantastic service that pretty much made the entire experience better. If we had another server, I probably would have thought a lot less.\n\nTruth be told, Globe's focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion. However despite that, it was a pretty good overall experience, opening jitters and stage fright aside. I think that once they work all the kinks out, there'll be nothing in Bloor West Village-an area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin with-that can even come close to competing with Globe.", "cool": 1, "date": "2011-06-01", "funny": 1, "review_id": "2Hk7DNwu3rb2jKHaFfPyCA", "business_id": "SmizR7MLt-558FJJQRBBoQ", "stars": 4, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "useful": 1}, {"text": "Despite it's seemingly religious name, this Blansdowne cafe has nothing to do religion. It's a little cafe chock-full of character and a cool, homey-sorta vibe. You know the type of place I'm talking about: mismatched plates and cutlery on the tables, Value Village-esque paintings and pictures on the walls, slightly damaged panelling on the ceiling. It sorta looks like one day someone decided: 'Well, we have a stove. Why don't we open a restaurant?' It seems random, but truthfully, it doesn't matter all that much. If anything, those details make it better and much more comfortable.\n\nThere really isn't that much for food here. They've got a couple of items that are fairly easy for the lone person working to make when the place gets busy, which it definitely does. Mostly it's just the standard pressed sandwich kind of thing. No soup, no fries, no salad, as a side anyways. The friendly guy working there told me that it's not that kinda place. He said that it's mostly a cafe and a place to drink booze.\n\nThe menu is up on a chalkboard, and like I mentioned, it mostly has pressed sandwiches, like grilled cheese with apples and Tandoori chicken stuffed Naan bread. The sandwiches certainly aren't bad, but sadly, the majority of the stuff they make seems to have been brought in with little of it made in-house, like the Naan bread. The Naan was the kinda stuff pressed and packaged somewhere distant, and then bought at some grocery retail giant. It definitely would have been better if they worked with someone local to get some truly authentic stuff. They do have quite a few baked goods too. I'm not sure if those were made in-house or not, but they look nice next to a cup of the great coffee they serve.\n\nI've seen some pictures of brunch items at Holy Oak, like eggs Benny, but based on when I was there I couldn't see that happening. Maybe they do bring someone in on the weekends to cook, but they guy working never mentioned it to me when I asked him about the food or the limited menu.\n\nI went during the week for lunch, and this little place was pretty packed. Mostly with twenty and thirty somethings in front of laptops. It seems like a pretty cool place to work for those of us that frequent coffee shops for that sorta thing, because there really isn't much else in the neighborhood that offers it. It's cozy and comfortable, and I could easily see myself sitting there with a coffee, comfortably typing away.\n\nHoly Cafe is a neat place, but it certainly doesn't warrant a big trip to get to it. If you happen to be in the neighborhood and you're looking for a comfortable place to soak up WiFi and get a decent cup of coffee, Holy Oak can definitely provide. But it doesn't offer much more than that.", "cool": 3, "date": "2011-04-17", "funny": 1, "review_id": "kUgUo3SfZDj_XwAECQtkjQ", "business_id": "HX0QhTVWztcawNof0KUhgQ", "stars": 3, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "useful": 5}, {"text": "Dr. Eap is a healer in the truest sense of the word.

Why, you ask? Oh so many reasons! Let's begin...\n\n1) It is not a chain restaurant! It is locally owned by a well trained chef. \n\n2) The Food. Ok, maybe this should be number one, but with the dominance of chain restaurants in Surprise, I think it is important that it is not a chain. But the food is FANTASTIC. I haven't had a thing I didn't love. My favorite is the Vogue Burger. It's big, but not so enormous that you have no idea how to eat it. The toppings are perfect, not overwhelming, and the meat melts in your mouth. All that yumminess for only $8!! What a deal!  I've also had the sweet potatoe fries (make sure you ask for the dipping sauces), the garden panini, the chicken panini, and the chicken salad (yes, we've been there a few times!) All were fantastic. \n\n3) The alcohol. No, I am not an alcoholic, but this is worth mentioning! The drinks here are great. I usually get wine, while my hubby will get beer. Both lists are great and reasonably priced (a great white wine for $6/glass). Also, the martinis are fabulous. They shake and pour at your table and they have many specialties. But, what I love most about the martinis is that they are sweet, but not blast of sugar sweet. Often when you order a sweet martini you are blown away from the sweetness factor. Not here! They are just perfect.\n\n4) It has very chic decor. Lots of outdoor seating which isn't great this time of year, but is fabulous when Arizona has nice weather. When does that happen again? Moving on...\n\n5) The manager and owners are awesome. We haven't been there once that they didn't stop by for a chat.\n\n6) It is local! I am a huge supporter of local businesses, which can be extremely challenging in Surprise. \n\nOk, now for a couple minor negatives. These are not significant enough to drop the star rating, in my humble opinion. \n\n1) Sometimes the servers can be a bit lacking. I think this is because the restaurant is still new and still learning. So, we overlook it and instead take the extra time to enjoy good conversation. \n\n2) It can be crazy busy. I guess that isn't a bad thing necessarily, but we can be spur of the moment and decide to head to Vogue. Luckily we can usually find a seat at the bar and order there. \n\nSo there you go.

Rebecca's name popped up near the top with great reviews stating how professional and involved she was (both very true).

I'm so glad I picked her! \n\nAfter sending her a detailed email of my situation and rental needs, she replied promptly and with positivity, reassuring me that while my situation was unique, it was hardly impossible. She set to work adding me to a database that would email me potential rentals that featured the specific things I was looking for. So awesome to be able to apartment hunt from your inbox! \n\nI did indeed find the perfect place, and I couldn't have done it without Rebecca. She made communicating with the landlords and their realtors a breeze and was able to prepare the lease and handle other details, freeing me to focus on other things associated with an international move.\n\nRebecca actually cares about her clients, and finding them the right rental or forever home is both her goal and her specialty.

Now you have 2 NOBU's gracing your city! Congrats to Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his business partner, Robert DeNiro (!!) on their beautiful newest creation..... NOBU at Caesar's Palace, LV!  \n\nFirst, a few fun facts:\n- The official ribbon-cutting was on February 2, 2013 \n- Of the 29 NOBU restaurants, this is the largest location worldwide! \n- The NOBU Hotel, a \"boutique hotel\" which is next to the restaurant (both in Caeser's) is the first \"NOBU Hotel\" ever! It has 181 rooms, and even features a number of suites with up to 5 rooms. One of these days, I WILL stay here.... the pics of the rooms are gorgeous...and get this, 24-hour availability to Nobu in-room dining room service. Eeeep! ;)  \n\nNow, back to the restaurant. You are greeted with an elegant entryway filled with origami birds overhead. Just past the check-in desk, you get a full glance of the beautiful modern & trendy main dining room filled with artistic lamps that look like floating jellyfish. There is a bar and lounge in the front area, sushi bar on the left side, and then the sea of seats filling the rest of the open & spacious layout. There are a variety of different style of seats to accommodate all different sizes of parties..... small tables for the romantic couples, larger booth tables (both circular and square), and secluded tables (in nest-like booth areas) for more private larger parties. There are also secluded areas for the teppanyaki grill tables. Overall, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, which sets the tone for the amazing food you are about to indulge in.\n\nNow, onto the FOOD! Below are the dishes (mostly signature favorites) that me and the hubby had.... Each one was fabulous, and extremely satisfying....!!\n\n1) Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - $28   (a MUST HAVE!)\nsix (heavenly!) thinly sliced pieces of yellowtail, with an even more thinly sliced piece of jalapeno on each. In a light ponzu sauce, and coupled with a piece of cilantro, this combo melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. This is my FAVORITE dish. I bet 99% of the people who get this are thinking \"should I order another round now or later?\" as they are finishing off this one ;) \n\n2) Black Cod w/ Miso - $34 (a MUST HAVE!)\nSo succulent & tender....every bite of it literally melts in your mouth! Don't \"pass\" on this one, thinking once you've had a good black cod, you've had em all. NOPE! This one is amazing & you should believe all the hype about it!! The sauce is light & sweet, and I just have a STRONG feeling you will not be disappointed :) \n\n3) Kumamoto Oysters with Nobu Sauce - $18 (a MUST HAVE!)\nThis comes with 3 oysters, each topped with a different garnishing (maui onion, \"las vegas\", and jalapeno). If you have a party of 2, I strongly suggest you get 2 orders so that each person can have their \"own\" trio :) It was super fresh n delicious! \n\n4) Rock Shrimp Tempura - $24 (a MUST HAVE!)\nOK, so per our server, this signature dish usually comes with either the Creamy Spicy or Butter Ponzu sauce.....but Exec Chef Thomas Buckley (who was brought over from the Miami Beach location) decided to throw in a 3rd sauce choice... Jalapeno! We couldn't decide between the butter ponzu & Jalapeno, so our server offered to bring it out not tossed, but with the 2 sauces 'on the side'. I suggest you do this, as both sauces were amazing and I think you can savor the flavors more with dipping rather than having it mixed in. Served on a bed of micro greens which also tasted good with the sauces. \n\n5) Spicy Miso Chips with Big Eye Tuna - $16\nThis was tasty but I felt that the plum sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowering. Would have loved this if the sauce was more subtle... \n\n6) Pork Belly Miso Skewer - $14\nIf you love pork fat, this is your dish! Comes with 2 skewers of incredibly butter-like pork cubes. Tasty, but again I thought there was a lil too much sauce.  My hubby thought it was delicious though!\n\nDessert\nWe went with one of the most popular picks -- The Bento Box - $15\nFlourless chocolate cake, with white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup, and house-made green tea ice cream. Delicious and the perfect way to wrap up a wonderful dinner experience. \n\nI'm already thinking about when I can go back again. Maybe Nobu will consider his next venue in the Bay Area?

To top it all off, we got a pretty hefty amount of food for a great price.

I've had many massages and that's what she did- no focus on the area /reason I went in there in the first place. And the fact that I paid $70 (not including tip) for this makes me uber regrettful.

Say what you will about that corporate beast, but in my opinion, David's Tea has had a firm hand in pushing tea into the hands of mainstream Toronto. So, in a market on its way to becoming pretty heavily saturated, what's Tea Blendz doing to differentiate themselves? Plenty...\n\nFirst off, it's not a corporate beast. It's a little boutique shop owned by Khadija, an incredibly nice person whose passion for all things tea-related is almost contagious. That feeling of non-corporateness runs throughout the experience at Tea Blendz. Khadija is easily approachable, encourages you to ask questions, and is obviously passionate about the stuff she's selling. Not to say that the staff at those corporate places aren't passionate, but at Tea Blendz, it just seemed more honest.\n\nThey also have a pretty kick-ass teaspresso machine--one of the only ones in Toronto right now I'm told. Basically, it allows them to quick-press loose-leaf tea rather then steep it. That means you can get it faster and cleaner, and the whole process is under more control of the brewer rather than being at the mercy of the boiling water. Your tea will still take a few minutes, but those few minutes can easily be spent talking to the warm and pleasant staff. In fact, I ended up staying and chatting about tea and the neighbourhood for far longer than those few minutes that my tea was pressed.\n\nUsing the teaspresso machine, Tea Blendz also brews up some pretty amazing tea lattes. Khadija claimed they were the best in the city, and I can't say I'd disagree with her. While I'm self-admittedly not a tea or tea latte expert by any means, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I could definitely see myself going out of my way to enjoy another one.\n\nKhadija works with local tea blenders to come up with a lot of her blends. They have plenty of classic flavours, like Earl Grey, English Breakfast, and Bourbon Street Vanilla, and some of that are hers and the blenders creation, like Chocolate Mint Delight, Root Beer Rooibos, and Sweet Pumpkin Spice. Despite being pressed and not steeped, the subtle flavours that the tea descriptions promised were still prevalent. I also picked up on a slight sweetness, which amazingly highlighted the even subtler flavours in the tea. All-in-all, I'd sort of equate it to wine-tasting; after tasting it, discussing the tea and its flavours seemed almost natural.\n\nKhadija mentioned that there's a growing trend in food and tea pairing. Because of that, I wondered if she planned on offering any food at some point, which right now she doesn't. I don't mean sitting down and eating a club sandwich and fries, but a small, one-bite of something that was specifically made just to be paired with a particular tea would certainly have been interesting. But Tea Blendz just opened a month ago, so things aren't yet set in stone.\n\nAll-in-all, I had a great chat with Khadija. I learned some stuff, and I even left with a few bags of tea. I brought home a bag of Chocolate Mint Delight and the Sweet Pumpkin Spice, and at 5 bucks for 50 grams, I left feeling pretty good about buying it.\n\nSo if you're in the neighbourhood, this honest-to-goodness, non-corporate boutique shop is definitely worth checking out and supporting. Even if you're not in the neighbourhood, it's worth the drive if you want to learn more about tea and if you appreciate truly nice customer service.", "cool": 6, "date": "2011-04-06", "funny": 0, "review_id": "jZ4bjL-A4X1iFtRzzvPLBQ", "business_id": "_mtAXGkVLLB6I9NddO-whQ", "stars": 5, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "useful": 6}, {"text": "Great atmosphere.

The Tempe location is the last of the 3 Bikram locations I've tried since January.  You do get the most bang for your buck by sticking with one location and taking advantage of the 20% off a class package.\n\nIt really is a state-of-the-art studio. The the studio itself has none of the sweaty \"smell\" mentioned in the other reviews. The anti-microbial \"carpet\" is my favorite flooring of all the Bikram locations I've been to. The corner farthest from the lobby door really IS the HOT side of the room but there are several fans so you can set your mat up near one to catch a hot breeze. Check out their website for lots of useful info about yoga etiquette & how to be ready for your first Bikram class. The shower/sink area is TINY for the number of people using the dressing room. \n\nThis location is celebrating their 10 year anniversary & is always BUSY!! Each class typically 40+ students in it & I think they MAX out around 50. Yes 50!! So the size of the class itself can be a bit intimidating if you're new to Bikram. The routine seems to be get there as early as you can, go lay out your mat in the spot of your choice & then sit in the lobby until 2 min before class.\n\nI've tried to change it up & try class with at least 10 different teachers. While the dialogue is basically the same, each one has their own energy & style. You can check the schedule online if you want to choose your class specific to the instructor. And several of the instructors actually do teach at more than one location. I really enjoyed classes with Charles, Ben & Jeremy.  All of them reminded us about the importance of BREATHING! My favorites phrase from Charles is so simple: \" I am inhaling. I am exhaling.\" It really helped me focus on controlling my breathing :) \n\nOne instructor actually finished about 8 minutes early and I did feel rushed! I was hoping it was just a fluke but the 2nd time I took her class the same thing happened.  There were 4 or 5 first-time Bikram students in the class and not once did she remind us about a 5 second in / 5 second out breath.

Perfectly cooked al dente pasta, with eggplant confit, roasted red peppers, arugula, and pine nuts. The eggplant, chopped so fine and reduced to a thick consistency, had such intense flavor. It clung to every noodle, making every bite equally tasty.\n\nHe enjoyed the Seared Scallops which were cooked perfectly.\n\nBroccolini with chili paste and sesame seeds, had just the right amount of heat and sweetness and crunchiness of the broccoli.\n\nPanzanella Salad - Can't beat the fresh tomatoes right now!\n\nBeet Salad - I am not a fan of beets, but was floored when I tasted, and ended up enjoying this salad. The beets were mild in flavor and just worked with the other ingredients, especially the goat cheese fondue.\n\nThere were lots of vegetarian options on the menu - I had a hard time picking.

If you cannot do your job properly, at least admit to the fact that sometimes mistakes happen, then I would've stayed with them as I am very lenient.\nHonestly, the quality of the work itself isn't too bad, and I would recommend this place if you feel like throwing away $100 every 3 days to have a different design as that's all they will do. \nHere's little kicker for everyone..

Low and behold we turn the corner and there is an BBQ plave that looks like it is inside a old train boxcar. We decided that this looked like a great authentic plave to grab a quick bite. The decor is fashioned from old school props wiyh mismatched chairs and tables. Not sure if i liked it or just garage sale junk they found. Our waitress comes over and asked it we ate there before. We say no and she explains the menu to us. She said the meat is slow roast everyday in house and flavorful. Looking at the prices we were a bit shocked especially for a lunch menu. $14 for a pulled pork sandwich and thats the cheapest thing on the menu. It came with 1 side and we both got garlic mashed potatoes.  Overlooked the price figuring the quality meat should be worth it.  Our drinks came in huge mason jars. The sweet tea was ok but I'be had better. The lemonade was way too sweet. Out comes our food about 20 mins later. The sauces were explained to us and i tried a couple of them but the werent good. The meat lacked flavor and was a small portion for the price. My bottom bun was already soggy and i jad to remove it. The potatoes were soo peppery that after one bite i couldnt eat it. I love garlic and this taste was definitely black pepper. I dont like to complain and rarely do but i really wanted a side and this was inedible. Our waitress was no where to be found and when she did come by my husband was almost done with his food.  I asked to have veggie instead cause i couldnt eat the potatoes...no problem she said she would switch it out. My husband then ordered corn bread cause he was done. Out comes his corn bread amd she said the veggies will be out shortly. The  cornbread was dry with really no flavor or sweetness. We finish and here comes the waitress with the veggies. She apologized and said the kitchen forgot about it. I asked for it to go since we were done. She brought it back in a box with our check. It came to almost $70 for a couple low quality soggy sandwiches and small sides. They double charged for the veggies and she said that shouldnt be on there and had to get a manager to take it off.

Jason was not rude, but let's just say he was a bit...snarky? smug? condescending?

This is a bar, after all, and I thought it was typical for people to have loud and lively debates, but I digress. As I challenged him because he clearly did not have his facts straight, he refused to be specific, only saying that \"other people\" concurred. Humbly, I admit that my husband and I can get a little heated in our conversations, WITH EACH OTHER, and if Jason could have identified what either of us said that was rude or offensive, perhaps I would understand. During this berating session, I just looked at him completely bewildered because we had been there less than 30 minutes. Whatever his goal, Jason handled the situation very poorly.

In the past, I've had only positive experiences and excellent food.  However, I recently stopped in for brunch with a few visiting friends and am now questioning if I will be returning which is a real shame.  I should start off by saying that my friends visiting from Philadelphia and DC were surprised by how high the prices were.  The food was, as always, well-executed, but the service was so unpleasant and condescending that it was hard to enjoy the experience.  One of us is vegetarian and we asked if it would be possible to get the meat on the side for two of the dishes.  This seemingly innocuous request was met with a snide quip that \"the chef doesn't believe in customizing his menu for the customer.\"  Fair enough, but I should mention that the vegetarian version of the dish is the same price and that we were directed to the sides menu if we wanted to pay for a similar protein to that left off of our order for $4 which we grudgingly obliged to do.  When the dish arrived, it was not in fact the vegetarian version we had ordered which we discovered as we started to dish it onto our plates.  They did replace the item promptly, but also snatched our plates with the food that had already been dished by the non-vegetarians which at that point seemed petty and wasteful.  I genuinely hope the front of the house and the chef tone down the attitude, because I'm sad to say it's going to take a while before I'm up to eating here again.", "cool": 0, "date": "2016-09-07", "funny": 0, "review_id": "nmZZKw1k0RILeMICAwU_Eg", "business_id": "wOKcWLyN1DhSEl3Y1eG5nQ", "stars": 2, "user_id": "2hlSNtuL2n6OKjF3TC9-_w", "useful": 0}, {"text": "BUGS IN THE COFFEE\n\nMy friend and I ducked in and sat down and instantly regretted it, but wanted to stay to be polite. \n\nThe food on the other tables looked really poor, and the elderly waitress didn't seem very interested, in addition to not being very good at speaking English. \n\nWe ordered the cheap breakfast, and 2 coffees....at which point my friend spooned one small insect out of his black coffee, and then another.

I'd give it 4  1/2 stars (I don't know why I don't give it 5), but Yelp doesn't seem to allow  1/2 stars.  The food is excellent, and the service was flawless.  If you can, try to get Alex (or Alec) as your waiter.  He is a Cary Grant of waiters.  They don't come any better than that. If you are fortunate enough to get him, you'll know what I mean.  \n\nAnyway, starting from the beginning, I don't usually drink--why waste money and calories on alcohol--but I decided to live a little and got The Drifter.  It was delicious--sweet, but not too sweet--a drink to be savored.  I didn't want to drink the last drop.  One drink was enough--they do not skimp on the alcohol.  One drink gives a nice glow.  \n\nAfter ordering dinner, I noticed an empty bread and butter plate on the table and wondered where the bread and rolls were.  I love good bread and rolls slathered with butter (which often means I'm not hungry when the real food comes).  At Gordon Ramsay Steak they bring out one little plate for the table, with little rolls (they look like cinnamon rolls but they aren't), small slices of focaccia, and a small portion of wonderful butter--sweet butter, with salt added to it.  You have to share the bread plate, and it looks like there's not enough, but there is.   It's enough to tide you over until the real food comes.  (By the way, we took a long time looking at the menu and there was no hurry to order something--we were treated like guests--and there were no long wait-times for anything.)    \n\nFor dinner, I started with the octopus and potato salad.  I'd never had octopus before, and I found out that it's tender and very mild, and nothing to write home about.  The potato salad was the best I've ever had.  It's mildly tart--subtle--with a little crunch.  The fingerling potatoes were perfectly cooked.  It doesn't need a couple slices of octopus to make it special.  But, potato salad is too heavy for a first course.  Seems to me it would be better suited as a side dish.   \nFor the main course, I had Beef Wellington, with creamed spinach and mac and cheese as sides.  When I ordered, Alex murmured (so only I could hear) \"that's a lot of food,\" and he was right.  I'd assumed the portions would be small, but they aren't.  Each of the side dishes (as well as the first course) could be shared by two people.  But, I was happy to have leftovers to take home. \n\nThe creamed spinach was yummy--it can't be made out of just spinach and cream.  I'd get it again, and I don't know if I'd share it. \n\nMac and cheese is one of my favorite dishes, and I've seen rave reviews about Gordon Ramsay's mac and cheese, but his mac and cheese is not the good old American mac and cheese I grew up with.  It's not gluey or what I would call \"comfort food.\"  It's light--the macaroni was perfectly cooked--and has a mild woodsy flavor.  While I was sitting at the table, I smelled occasional whiffs of wood smoke, which brought back memories of the smell of the wood cabins we stayed in when I went camping with the Girl Scouts 60 years ago.  Turns out, it was the mac and cheese being served at other tables.  My niece told me that one of the ingredients of Gordon Ramsay's mac and cheese is truffle oil.  Well, even though it wasn't what I expected, I've decided I like Gordon Ramsay's mac and cheese.  I had some as leftovers, and it I grew on me.  I suppose it's the truffle oil that grew on me. Truffle oil!\n\nI've saved the best for last.  The Beef Wellington is wonderful. It was perfectly cooked.  I can't imagine why anyone would order a steak, even the steaks at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  The beef tenderloin in perfectly cooked Beef Wellington almost melts in your mouth.  Gordon Ramsay gets the well-deserved credit for the restaurant--his name is on it, it is his standards and probably his recipes for a lot of the dishes--but the chefs deserve the credit for how well the food is actually prepared, day after day, dish after dish.    \n\nI do not have anything negative to say about Gordon Ramsay Steak--even the paper towels in the restrooms are exceptional--very thick paper, almost like cloth.  Everyone there was nice.  Some reviews say it's loud, but I didn't notice that.  We were in the balcony and maybe that makes a difference.  As to the price, when my nephew's company had a conference at the MGM Grand, his wife and eight-year- old son had a very modest breakfast there and were charged $60 dollars!   I'd say Gordon Ramsay Steak is very good value for the money. \n\nI've eaten in great restaurants in Chicago, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Denver, Cincinnati, etc., and I can say, without any qualification, that Gordon Ramsay Steak is a great restaurant.   I've got to say, as good as it is, if I went back and Alex were not my waiter, I'd be a little disappointed.

The first slice came out 10 minutes later, so I asked her for a take-out container and the bill. She offered to put the rest of our order in take-out containers as well, which we gladly accepted. A few minutes later she brought out the rest of our order, except my friends milkshake was not the one she had ordered. She had never ordered it before but it didn't look like cookies and cream (it was yellow) so she asked the server to confirm, and she said yes. A few seconds later she came back and realized she had given her the wrong milkshake, just as my friend went in for a sip. She told our server that she had tried to take a sip of it, though she hadn't actually tried it yet. I guess our server took this as an okay to give the drink to the person who actually ordered it, because we later watched her and another girl behind the counter SWAP THE STRAWS and bring it out to another table. That's pretty unhygienic and I feel like anyone who's ever worked in food service knows that once that food is out of your sight, you do not give it to another person. \nSo we waited another 10 minutes for a new milkshake to come out (during this time we paid our bills), though we saw it sitting on the counter in a glass cup ready to go 5 minutes before it was brought to us.
