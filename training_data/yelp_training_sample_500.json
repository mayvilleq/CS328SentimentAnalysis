Probably her tenacity.  And no - I don't mean that she digs and digs into your muscles (although she'll probably do that too if you like - she's strong!).  I mean, she doesn't give up.  When you pay for a 60 minute massage with her, you're not just paying for 60 minutes of work.  Lena digs into the problem...the real root cause!  When you leave she takes time to study your case, understand what may be causing your symptoms and how to fix them.  She even takes continuing education courses to learn how to address your issues (as long as they're physical that is!).  She is smart, smart, smart!  \n\nIf you are looking for resolution, look no further!  Forget the chiropractor who needs you to sign up for a 20 visit plan or a massage \"club\" with groupon discount prices...go schedule an appointment with someone who will actually help you understand and treat your specific problem.

The first time I got a specialty pizza from them it was amazing, and every time after that it's either been burnt or cold or covered in grease.\n\nI might be able to come to terms with the long wait and the barely adequate customer service (at least with delivery and pick up, I've never sat down and eaten in the restaurant, though I have exchanged pleasantries with one of the waitresses and she seems friendly) if the food were consistently good, but it's not.\n\nI've done call ahead pick-up, I've done order and wait for it pick up, and I've done delivery through their website.\n\nThe last time I ordered and picked up, they gave me the wrong pizza and I didn't realize it til I got home (my fault to a point, I probably should've looked at it).  It had onions and mushrooms on it, which I don't like, so it wasn't like I could just eat it anyway.  I called them and the guy asked: \"What you want me to do?  You want I deliver new pizza, you want credit, or you want pick up new pizza?\"\n\nI feel I should note that I used to work as a server.  I realize mistakes happen.  Despite being hungry, tired, and frustrated, I made sure I was pleasant-- I did not insult anyone or raise my voice.\n\nBased on my previous experience with delivery with them and the facts that I didn't want to wait 45 minutes for a new pizza and I'd already put $2 in the tip jar at the counter and didn't want to tip a delivery driver on top of that, I drove back and got a new (correct) pizza, which was smothered in cheese (I originally had asked for them to go easy on the cheese).  \n\nThe guy apologized 3-4  times, which I appreciate, and it seemed that I got a lot of extra toppings on the new (correctly made) pizza, but I found it extremely disappointing that a handful of apologies was my only compensation for being an understanding customer (\"Hey man, it's cool, it's just a pizza, no one died,\" is something that I said.)  \n\nI feel I should've been offered a discount on my next order or offered a free dessert or breadsticks or something to compensate for the fact that I had to drive back to get my order correct.  Now, maybe I should've SAID that (\"Hey, uh, can I get a discount on my next order or get a free dessert or something?\"), but I don't feel that as a customer I should have to make suggestions.  I once witnessed a couple go in there and complain that they'd been waiting an hour for delivery.  They were handed their order free.  So I'm nice, drive back to pick up my order when they got it wrong, and I get compensated with a few extra pieces of chicken and some cheese that I didn't want on my new correct order?  I guess the squeaky wheel really does get the most grease.\n\nUnfortunately for them, this was their last chance with me.  As I mentioned, out of anywhere from 7-10 chances over the course of 3 months, they've disappointed me more often than they've dazzled me.  As soon as I opened that box and got the wrong pizza I turned to my husband and said: \"That's it, we're never going to Giovanni's again.\"  With his mouth full of hoagie he asked:  \"Aww, are you sure?  Because this hoagie's really good,\" and I replied: \"Well, let me see if they can make it up to me,\" and they didn't.\n\nSo if you wanna roll the dice, you might have some amazing pizza, but you also might have to wait half an hour for something cold or burnt.

In some of the dishes that come with sauce (Paneer Makhani and Butter chicken), there was too much sauce, and too little paneer / chicken.

The bartender approached me and asked me what I would like. I said just a glass of water. She asked if I wanted anything else and I said no I'm fine. She gave me a disgruntled look and walked away. Shortly after, another bartender approached me and asked me if I wanted anything and I said I was okay. He said would you like a menu. Feeling a little guilty I agreed to take one but said I ate earlier. He then asked if I had any intention of ordering anything. I said I wasn't sure and then I offered to give up my seat if more people came, after which he then left. I immediately got off my seat and left the establishment.\n\nI can't recall anytime in recent history being treated like that. While I respect the need for establishments to make money and to attract paying customers, it did not sit well with me that I could not even sit down at their bar and relax for a few moments with a drink of water. On plenty of occasions I've gone to other establishments and not been hassled over ordering water. If treated nicely or if the bar was crowded, I would tip when given water or would order something since I do understand their business needs. However, treating a potential customer like a vagrant off the street and not offering any initial hospitality is not a wise business model. This form of treatment makes them feel insulted and not only discourages them from becoming paying customers, but encourages them to write negative reviews and to share their story word of mouth to anyone who will listen.\n\nIf management is so adamant that every person entering their establishment is a paying customer then they must make it into a policy that is clear to incoming patrons. This can be done by putting up signs and also by training personnel to respectfully inform patrons of this policy when they sit at the bar. Digressing, if the bar was crowded and if I continued to order water then I could see their point.\n\nOne other point I should make is that I had just spent $60 at Casbah, the adjacent restaurant, which if I understand correctly, is operated under the same management. Regardless, no incoming patron deserves to be treated like a deadbeat. Any successful business model incorporates courtesy, respect, hospitality, and the crazy notion that any incoming patron has the potential to become a repeat customer if they are treated right. From the treatment I received, I can see that either no such model exists for this establishment, or the hiring or training regimen is in need of some TLC. The experience I had infuriated me and, short of a sincere apology, I will never go back and will share this experience with others.", "funny": 0, "review_id": "iOYGRXsKE_veVexFXmpV_A", "date": "2014-06-15", "user_id": "5Z3aJjyr8YD892R7jw_3Iw"}, {"business_id": "RkwUT-ohIxqfYXJBWn_W0g", "stars": 2, "cool": 0, "useful": 2, "text": "The best thing about this trail ride was the weather.

I recently moved to phx and this place was close to my house and under my insurance network. Not knowing the truth behind this place (huge corporation, services in 33 states with 550 franchised dental facilities that serve over 15,000 patients a day, Its headquarters is in DeWitt, New York, East Syracuse.) I moved forward and booked my appt. First- be prepared for a flood of emails and texts regarding your appt. I finally had to call and ask to be taken off their emailing list and that txt is fine. My appt. was at 1pm- I get there 12:50pm the receptionist says \"they'll all be back from lunch @1:30pm\" why the fuck am I scheduled for a 1pm appt. then? I fill out paper work, 3 patients walk in at seperate times between 1:10-1:30pm. It's around 1:45pm, someone who got there after me gets called back. Minutes later another one of the three gets called back. A few minutes later the third person gets called back. All while I've been sitting there before any of them walked in. It's around 2-2:10pm I get called back. The tech. Says we need to do X-rays. She obviously does not know what she is doing. Finally we finish. I am taken back and wait for the dentist. The dentist arrives says my teeth are good no cavities. The hygienist then comes, and is calling out numbers - apologizes for stabbing me with her dental apparatus. She says I have signs of early gingivitis. NEVER ever have I been told this, in fact quite the opposite. I've been told I have really nice cared for teeth. Next the hygienist says I'll be meeting with the financial coordinator. WTF? So I go into this room, and (my bf is a salesman- I know all the tricks) she immediately tells me I will need work costing 650-700$ And how would I like to move forward with payment? I literally laughed in her face. After I composed myself from laughing, I said ok, well we need to have a conversation because you can bet I'm not going to pay shit for something I have not agreed to do. (Well I was much nicer about it of course). I said first of all I don't need the toothbrush - which I 99.9% believe it's not covered so no I do not want it. I do not want the gel and paste your trying to sell me either. Unless ofcourse it's covered- which I doubt it is. I said I am literally here for my cleaning which is covered and that is it, so may I book an appt. for that? She said well since you've been diagnosed we can't treat you for anything other than what the hygienist has recommended first (the early stages of gingivitis). I said wel this is the first I'm hearing of this- I've only been told my teeth and mouth are in good condition so I'm going to have to get a second opinion. This was the only time she actually started to be helpful - once I threaten to take my business elsewhere. She started deducting the toothbrush, gel, and paste and said well if we deduct all of that your payment is only around 200$. I said I would book the appt. but I'm going to look around for a second opinion- she said well we need 60% deposit to book the appt. I have NEVER EVER had to pay to book an appt. for a dental visit. I said ok I do not want anything i decline everything, and I'll take my business elsewhere. \n\nPlease ppl DO NOT go to aspen dental, they are crooks ripping you off!!!! Luckily I know all the sales techniques I knew to get out of there immediately. The thing about sales is when it's a good deal- they don't shove it down your throat with unessary fluff it's straight forward, to the point, and sounds good. This is ALL bad and they try to do it fast and make it as confusing as possible so you leave thinking \" what the fuck did I just agree to?\" But at that point it's too late. DO NOT agree to anything. This company is owned by corporate fucks who know nothing about dental care. They are in the $$$$ business. And will bleed you dry. After this I immediately went online and found out they are a huge corporation owned by people who know nothing about dental care.

First visit was great although it was quite early and they started by saying \"order fast we have limited dough left\".  We thought that was a bit odd.  Not really a service problem per se.   Second visit service was just too cool, rushed and we didn't feel overly welcomed.  Service is a 2.5. \n\nVenue....hmmm.   I respected the art.  My wife felt afraid.  It was curious and begged some thought.  I wouldn't bring a small child here at night.  Maybe not even during the day.   It was dark and hipster cool.   But not overly comfy and the open kitchen was a blessing and a curse.    \n\nHygiene.  The place was clean.  I will give them that.  The owner was there and we watched in amusement as he would: decorate a pizza, touch machinery and storage bins, hike his baggy jeans, adjust his ball cap, then back to food.  It became a game for us to see how many unclean things he could touch before returning to food.   It kinda grossed us out.  If we were truly concerned we would have left so it was more amusing than anything.   And a bit gross.  I'd give it like a 2 on that whole aspect.    \n\nWhat's most important?   Well.  All of it.  You go out for a meal.  And you pay good money.  The art of the game for restaurateurs is to deliver all of these things a price point that represents value.  It's not easy to do.   \n\nIf it were me, I would slightly adjust the art to eliminate the dead women with eyes gouged out, diligently train \"friendly\" into my servers and keep the open kitchen but proudly show off \"best in class\" hygiene - wash stations (being used) hair nets, clean white uniforms.

(And it's not even close).\n\nFor the past several years, there seems to be a plethora of BBQ restaurants poppin' up in the Valley. And each one claims to have a different regional style when it comes to their BBQ, and many places carry similar items, but done with their own personal taste. While there are places doing good ribs (Rollin' Smoke) or good pork (Jessie Rae's), there is not one single place in town doing good brisket. Except today, when I went into Big B's Texas BBQ.\n\nI saw this new business when Heather N. checked into here. Always on the lookout for good BBQ, and I noticed it was close to where I was at the time, I noticed it was around lunch, so I had to get my grub on.\n\nIt's located behind the Raising Cane's on St. Rose Pkwy, there is a lot of parking so don't worry about it. After walking in, I knew I was in the right place. Even though there is a little bit more finishing up when it comes to the interior, it does scream Texas style BBQ. Sort of like that BBQ place that was on the King of the Hill cartoon (Sugarfoot's?). Anyways, after ordering some meats, paid my bill, then sat down.\n\nBrisket - Man.. that is some brisket. Not only the best brisket in Vegas, but one of the best ones I've ever had in my life. I'm sure a Texas BBQ connoisseur would probably be more qualified to talk about the subject, but I really like a very tender brisket, and that is what is missing from all the other spots in town. There is an actual 'smoke ring' that you can see on it. It wasn't plain or dry. It was truly a spectacle to behold.\n\nTri-tip - I had a old friend who attended UT at Austin back in the day, and I asked him if tri-tip was as popular as brisket. He said he really didn't see it that much. I did some research and found out that it was more of a California thing. But the way that Big B's does tri-tip, Texas should think about adopting the tri-tip as part of their BBQ style, because the one at Big B's is phenomenal. Absolutely tender, and it just melted, and that smoke ring doe.... I was just floored.\n\nThe sauces were great as well. I personally don't like a BBQ that's so sugary sweet, I liked that Big B's was more about spice, and subtle amounts of sweetness, and complexity of flavor. There are two of them, a red and orange colored one, and I liked swirling both of them, and playing with them on top of my brisket and tri-tip.\n\nTexan's know their beef and Big B's knows how to cook it correctly. If you're tired of dry, flavorless brisket in Vegas, I would definitely recommend this spot. I would also like to see some reviews by some Texan transplants to see if I'm right, or just crazy.

It was a very long wait only to have a different medical assistant (Becky) come in yawning and acting like she was on drugs.  I was shocked with her behavior.  The visit with Dr. Solomon was fine and she prescribed me some medications.  One of them after going to the pharmacy required a pre-authorization, which has been a nightmare.

I called and left a message and was told they re-submitted the information.  I told them that additional blood work was need with the response of, \"Oh yes, your right.\"  I went to the office to pick up the form to go someplace else for the blood work (20 minute wait to pick up a form).  The blood work was completed within a couple of days and they sent the results to both myself and the Dr.  It is now over 8 weeks and my insurance denied the claim due to the length of time it took my Dr. to take care of the paperwork.

Many associate Portuguese food only with the many little rotisserie chicken places that dot the city, but the cuisine is so much deeper then that.  Hearty dishes of salt fish and potato, roasted whole suckling pig, fresh seafood aplenty and some damn good fried pork rinds are just a few worth mentioning.  Avoid falling in to your comfort zone, leave the rotisserie chicken with the tasty red sauce, the rice and the potato balls in the coup and try something fabulous and new.  Want to know where to start?  Well check out my appetizer only choices below.\n\nPortuguese cuisine is also known for this dish.  Caldo Verde.  It is Kale soup, however it can be made with many different types of greens.  It has the consistency of Chinese corn soup, a light flavor, is made with chorico and is a flavorful starter.\n  \nCan anyone say cheese heaven.  Queijo Fresco or fresh Portuguese cheese reminiscent of a formed ricotta served with the famous tasty red sauce or Piri-Piri.  Piri-Piri is a chili based sauce and always has tons of flavor.  The cheese is refreshing, clearly fresh and a cheese lovers delight.  Just like ricotta, it is perfect with just about anything.  You have to try this.  \n\nPortuguese cuisine is also known for its baked goods and breads.  I ate the cheese with the bread and bit of the Piri-Piri.  So good.\n\nTheir famous flaming sausage.  It is a chorizo style sausage set on fire with Portuguese moonshine in the clay vessel above just enough to grill the outside.

The Buffet at Aria is smaller than Bellagio with fewer choices, but (and it is a BIG BUT), the selections of food are great! They have exactly what I like to eat and I'm happy to eat everything they have. The merits of Aria's buffet are: a quick elevator ride from your room (rather than a 25 minute walk, ride, walk to Bellagio), shorter lines than Bellagio and quicker to fill your plate.

My pizza, the prosciutto one, was very good. I'll come out and say it's \"still just pizza\" and risk the wrath of the Yelp community, but it's good pizza- well sauced, thin crust, those little smoky bits on the edges....

I normally do most of my own maintenance on my Rover , simply for the fact I enjoy it and do not trust many to handle it in a professional and none up-sale manner. \n\nBACK STORY:\n\nI called a local Indie Rover mechanic in chandler (will remain nameless) and right off the bat he is trying to tell me that my Rover may this or that, even after I explained to him I had pulled the fault code with my scanner and know what the issue is. After going back and forth he says \"yeah i can do it\" I said great and asked when, becasue I already had the premium Bosch replacement part.   \n\nThis is when the fun starts and the end of my ever dealing with this guy: He begins to tell me how I shouldn't trust just any part, which I don't, and goes on-and-on about how if I get the part through him he can warranty it and blah blah blah. For fun I ask how much for part and how much for installation. He quotes me $250.00 total, with $100 of that price being the instal!!! I shot back with the fact I had purchased the BEST factory suggested replacement already for $40.00 and have it in hand. \n\nThis makes him upset or something, as he continues down the path of suggesting I cannot trust such a part, and that he'll throw it in without diagnosing for a 100.00, but he wouldn't warranty anything (which is fine, as I am supplying the part) ... this goes on for another five minutes and i finally let the guy know I ain't buying what he's selling, and go about my day.\n\nSo....\n\nI call ADS after reading reviews and with them being close to my home in Ahwatukee, I figure why not. I instantly get service writer \"Adam\" on the phone, I explain the situation, just like before to the rip off artist and get this reply,\"bring it in and we will swap it out, no problem\" that's it, that's all, nothing more.  He literally did not try to sell me, or shoot down my part in any way. I was blown away by that and knew I had found my place, but the best part is he was going to do it for $70 total!!!! WOW! \n\nIn shock and almost not believing it; I said alright, then proceeded to take my truck down, and sure as the sun will shine he called a few hours later, problem fixed for $70. An honest mechanic and fantastic shop right in my own backyard.\nADS has, and will continue to earn my business and my recommendation as a go to shop for automotive needs. \n\nOh, my diagnosis was right and my part fixed the problem, so the indie mechanic dude just sounds more and more like a rip off artist.", "funny": 2, "review_id": "FgVBWQCIP_8RySzzSLbf7w", "date": "2012-04-10", "user_id": "anHzk1C0oQRtfuDj74p2RQ"}, {"business_id": "ATeOjZzE3VOI-RW7FUFJpQ", "stars": 3, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "text": "Good foodie place.

I understand that they don't want strangers going into the facility. But after I introduced to her that we are new to school and don't have the code, I expected some friendly guidance. Instead of letting us in and show us where the classroom is, she closed the gate behind her and locked us outside while other families are also waiting to get in. \n\nAfter we got in, my kids' teacher was late. While I was waiting for him to show up, no one came to introduce us to the daily routine, such as sign-in, gate code, where to put lunch, backpack, etc..It's not that they don't have help, several teachers were sitting on the bench and did nothing.

After our dinner at China Poblano, I learned to pay more attention to what else was up there, which was the reason why I zeroed in on Holstein's.  And hey - any restaurant serving burgers that even utilizes the COW'S FREAKIN' NAME, had better be ready to 'bring it', as far as I'm concerned.  So when Bear and I selected it for our burger fix, we were prepared for - at the very least - a 'transformative experience.'\n\nSo was it THAT kind of deal? Nope, not really.  But you could do SO much worse.\n\nFirst of all - as promised - I have to give a shout-out to our server, Amanda.  Just that right, attractive combination of smiles, sass and 'savoir faire'' (NOTE TO MANAGERS: GET this woman a raise, STAT!) I've always loved that in the better restaurants in town, the staff always have an 'inside/out' knowledge of the menu and the daily specials, and in this particular area, Amanda did not disappoint. (Which is why Holstein's gets an extra star.)  With so many different styles of burger to choose from, it could have been an all-day task to select just one, but with her help, I chose the Nom-Nom Burger ($16.50), while Bear went \"classic\" and got the Gold Standard ($17.50). \n\nPricey? Well, DUH! What does anybody expect when they're using Kobe and dry- aged sirloin to craft the frickin' burgers? (And don't forget - this IS a 'Strip' joint we're talking about here, people!) And while we waited - but not for long - we got to check out the unique decor that included anime-style artwork of the Holstein's \"mascot\".  Cute...especially considering that he's on the menu as well as the wall!\n\nFor our 'intro', we had the Buffalo Chicken Dip ($12.00) a cluckin'-good twist on chili con queso served with warm tortilla chips, and Bear's 'de rigeur' item to try, the Cuban Street Tacos ($13.00) a delicious menage-a-trois of roast pork, ham and Swiss lovingly drizzled with pickle and spicy mustard aioli. The bite I had of one of them made me wonder if I should've gotten a separate appetizer as well....\n\nAnd then came the burgs.  Bear liked his Standard just fine, and I added some 'meat candy' (aka BACON!) to my Nom-Nom for about two bucks more. I didn't know if I expected a burger with barbecue potato chips and 1000 Island dressing to actually work, but damn if didn't, and in quite a tasty way, too. (But then again...name one thing that doesn't taste better with bacon on it.)  It was quite the stunning companion to my Frozen Grasshopper Shake ($11.00).  And the fries served with were just the way I like them: crispy, spicy shoestrings, with none of the greasiness you get from other burger joints.\n\nSo, sure, Holstein's is giving up burgers, but not at Jack-In-The-Box prices, so it's always best to keep that in mind.  And as repeat visits go, I think we can file this one under \"Special Occasions\" mostly.  And we will always ask to be seated in Amanda's section...", "funny": 0, "review_id": "g0n9hLKNJi33Gr7aSO0hYQ", "date": "2012-12-02", "user_id": "_Mz4d66zzJUX830jTwCgIQ"}, {"business_id": "K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "text": "Just like what everyone else is saying ... the dessert selection is presented in a very BEAUTIFUL AND UNIQUE WAY ...

The first time I was not impressed. I came for the second time because it is close to my house and pretty affordable. The first time I came was a few years ago, so I thought it may have gotten better right? Wrong. Very very wrong. The first thing that worried me was that I was going to have a male technician. I have ALWAYS had bad experiences with male techs. I decided to bite my tongue and pray for the best. He started off by cutting my cuticles and obviously does not know how to properly cut. He was cutting my skin and hurting me. Then we get to the massage. It was honestly the worst massage I have ever had. He basically slapped the lotion on and was talking in Vietnamese to his colleagues the entire time. It was not 10 minutes that the brochure promises. More like 6. Then comes the hot stones. Oh goodness, reliving this is painful! He put the hot stones on my foot first and I yelped! It was so incredibly hot I felt it burn my skin. I said \"whoa that is way too hot!!\" He chuckled, said okay, then put them back on that foot in the same spot! I had to pull my foot away and say YOU ARE BURNING ME! Even the nail tech next to him said \"too hot! That's too hot fo her!!\"   The color was just the basic polish but came out looking good. my mom loved her nails and that is the only reason I am giving them 2 starsDo not waste your money here.

I asked the first lady who approached me how much it would cost for shellac acrylic nails and she took a few seconds calculating in her head and finally said it would be $40.

They talked in Vietnamese with the other workers and said ''if she wants Lynn then tell her to come another time because its her day off today'' in an annoyed tone. Another lady came up to me to actually do my nails and she spoke the best English. I did tell her I understood what they were saying and she proceeded to tell all the workers that I understood and they started to change the way they talked or what they talked about. I was annoyed the whole time because they started to watch what they were saying. Anyways, the lady who did my nails knew I had my nails done before because of the glue that was still there. I asked her how much it was for acrylic shellac and she confidentially told me $25 acrylic + $10 for shellac so $35. That's when I knew I would never come back. The women told me $40 earlier, and the one who did my nails who spoke perfect English told me $35. I was so unsatisfied with my nails and their hospitality that I didn't tip. I felt like because I asked for Lynn, she didn't care to properly apply my nails on or care to really do my nails. The shapes of my nails are all different and uneven, which I looked at and she said don't worry she will fix it, but she just tried to file it to make it 'even' which made it worse and the nail was shorter and sharper than the rest.

Chicken Bonz came up as number 1 most reviewed for the SW.\n\nSo after we hit my friends, we went over to Chickn Bonz on Durango and Warm Springs. It's kinda hidden from the street as your going east to west on warm springs, so look for it behind a jack in the box I think it was.\n\nAnyway, pulled up about 8pm on a Saturday night, got out of vehicle and.... fell in love instantly....with the sign i read.\n\nALL YOU CAN EAT CHICKEN WINGS - $12.95\n\nReally!!? REALLY?!?! YIPPEE KI YEAAAAAAAA MOFO!\n\n*ahem*\n\nAnyway, proceeded inside, nice sports barish atmosphere with neon signs, and cool memorabilia on the wall, not a big sports fan so didn't really pay attention. Few video games, and nicely decorated. Ordered our food from the smokin' hot counter girl, that was mutli-tasking like a mofo. Good size crowd taking up most of the tables, got our pitcher, and chilled for about 10 minutes till we got our food. The girls ordered a juicy looking burger that they shared, totally enjoying the texas toast used as a bun instead of the normal McD's bun. Nice. For the AYCE you get 10 to start, and have to order in increments of 5 after that. \n\nOrdered the Garlic Salsa somethin somethin at the counter of the about 10-12 different flavors they had. I can't remember because the counter girl was hot and I was distracted. \n\nAnyway, I was expecting tiny little wings like you get at Hooters (I go for the wings) and l and behold, good size pieces of  wings filling up the little tray basket. slathered in my choice sauce. The cool counter person working by herself came up and apologized for it taking a little longer than expected, but she was single handedly handling the entire front by herself with about 15-20 customers on the floor, and about 8 in line AND asnwering the phone, and rocking getting everybody's order in. I worked retail/food the last 11 years and give her kudos, she even managed to compliment my homegirl's tattoo in the middle of all of it!\n\nThe wings filled me up surprisingly quick, convinced we were going to sit there for at least two hours  (my homegirls know I love wings) I ended up ordering just one more set of wings and I was content, fat and happy after just 15 wings. I was not surprised with the good size delicious wings, and threw in the  towel at 15. My friends were surprised I was done too. I only tasted the Garlic Chili and Teriyaki, but will go back to try the other ones. \n\nHad a definitely enjoyable experience, wish the place was a little bigger, as far as choice of seating, but perfectly good time eating some wings.\n\nI live in the north, but will drive down to the SW just for the service, atmosphere and great experience I had with my friends at this location, even though there's another one I guess 10 minutes away from where I live. (I asked the counter girl)\n\nGood Job Chicken Bonz! and Good job Smokin hottie Counter Girl!

The rice was aromatic and more interesting than simple white rice. My favourite dishes would have to be the chick peas and chicken tikka masala. The sheekh kabab was delicious. We were also served rice pudding and fried cheese balls for dessert. I didn't like either but then again, I don't like Indian desserts in general. \n\nThe waiter was friendly and efficient.

It literally opened a month before I arrived here so the stars aligned for this to happen (haha). \n\nIt is located inside the mall which so far has not been inconvenient though I'm sure parking can get bad during the weekend. I did have trouble finding the store initially just with how the mall is laid out. It is a couple stores down to Forever 21 (which I knew but since F21 has two entrances I still ended up walking a lot), but the easiest way to find it is to go through the Rainforest Cafe entrance. Once you walk in it will be to the right with the eye catching yellow layout. You can't miss it! \n\nSo forr the boba...I get The Original (literally what it's called) with honey boba. I always try out the regular milk tea whenever I try a new boba spot. It is a taaaad sweeter than what I would prefer, but overall a really good milk tea. The honey boba is sweet as well and has a nice texture. It comes in two sizes: baby fat and fat cup. (If you've ever been to Purple Kow you know what kind of cups these are). I used to think these cups were cool, but it does get annoying to hold and they don't fit in most cup holders. They do have these very fancy straws that come in these sleek black wrappers (hence why they probably don't have them laying around in the store). \n\nI've also ordered the Ice Age drink which is pretty much like a green milk tea. I didn't like this one quite as much, which is okay since I normally like black tea when I get milk tea any ways. I've tried a few sips of the Cali Girl as well which is a slushy fruit drink. This is also quite sweet, but good if you're not a milk tea drinker. \n\nMy only gripe about this place is the price...sadly it's quite expensive for boba. I'm used to paying these kind of prices being in San Francisco, but not so much in AZ so paying over $5 for a cup of boba does kinda hurt.

The frickles were also delicious - with a snap to them and a sauce that was to die for - I could have put that stuff on everything!\n\nMy cocktail was the Soda Popinski.  Not being a fan of sweet cocktails - I tend to go for the tart ones or bourbon laced ones.  This was Grey Goose, Fresh Lime, and Ginger Beer - so perfectly tart and packed a real punch! Loved it!\n\nFor my entree - I was torn.  I finally gave in and ordered the Double Dog Dare.  This was two bacon-wrapped wagyu hot dogs, topped with guacamole, pico de gallo, and chicharones. So double the pork on top of fancy beef dogs - you cannot go wrong. But damn - this was a LOT of food.  I didn't want the fries it came with, so I asked for a substitute of the Mac and cheese.  I was warned it would cost extra - yeah, I'm in Vegas - I don't care.  So I opted for the smoked gouda mac and cheese with broccoli.  Not too shabby, but I've had better.\n\nThis is not a hot dog you can eat with your hands - you have to use a knife and fork.  Not that I minded - because it was DAMN good.  Honestly, I don't think it needed the guac and pico - just all that pork goodness and leave it be...maybe a fancy mustard and walk away. But I was happy - and seriously, could not eat it all (such a shame).\n\nFor \"dessert,\" they had boozy milkshakes.  How can you NOT get a salted caramel shake packed with bourbon?  Especially when they offer to put it in a to-go cup?  Exactly.  It was my birthday, after all.\n\nOverall, the service was slow and we had to split up the check ourselves.  Our waitress said it would take her SO long to do it, so we took care of it on our own.  This is from the server who had trouble keeping our water glasses full (we might have ordered extra cocktails from her, but it was taking too long) and my mac and cheese came out late and I had to remind her about it - I still ended up with the fries.  So service loses them a star, but the food keeps them at 4 stars (plus honoring of the reservation despite us being late).\n\nThanks Mr. Mina - you know I will be back again.", "funny": 0, "review_id": "BwK1dtm7xCviC2WaWcbbqQ", "date": "2014-03-27", "user_id": "hTEKSL52x8cUUlHpUEx4lw"}, {"business_id": "EyPDvFnc8Jh1kAZZMHoApQ", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "text": "Yummy yummy yummy!!

They offered to fix my nails even though it was past their normal fix period of one week. I went in today to get my nails re-done. Although the new manicurist seemed a little annoyed she had to fix my nails, she did a great job. I left with a great gel manicure. Most importantly, there wasn't a gap between my polish and my cuticle like my first manicure at Polished.\n\nI really appreciate Polished reaching out to me. It shows me that they're really interested in making sure their customers are happy, and I will be back.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: Although I was initially happy about my experience at Polished, I will not be going back.\n\nI made what I now believe to be a mistake of telling the manicurist at Polished that it was my first ever manicure. (I think her name was Kandy.) She did my nails, even helping me pick out a color. I inspected my nails before I left the salon. Everything looked good except I noticed there was lots of space between my nail and the gel polish. When I mentioned this to the girl who cashed me out, she said my cuticle had been pushed back and would eventually cover that space. I paid $60 dollars for a gel manicure (including tip.) \n\nTwo days later, the gap between my nail and the polish grew even wider. A week out, the gap looks more like the Grand Canyon. The gel nail polish may last three weeks, but I'm not going to walk around with a huge space between the polish and the cuticle. I'm going in next week to get it removed. \n\nFor $60, a manicure that looks decent for two days is not worth it.", "funny": 2, "review_id": "gtOmXKfFKB7ZI-Ix2HC6VA", "date": "2014-01-04", "user_id": "c2wGkrX311rMD9vUH23FvQ"}, {"business_id": "e12N4_X0SNTs02YRMJVqvw", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "text": "This is the only place I have ever boarded my dog where she runs in when I drop her off, rather than trying to run out.

They were here within a timely manner. My egg rolls were ok...just tasted old.   The sweet and sour sauce was the worst. I LOVE chinese and love sweet and sour sauce. First off, it smelled like sweet and sour sauce mixed with puke. I'm not kidding. I wouldnt say that to be mean, it is LITERALLY what it smelled like. We liked the crab puffs...just didnt have anything GOOD to dip them in. We both ordered teriyaki combo plates, and pork fried rice as well. Rice was ok...not much flavor. Hub never even got to his teriyaki last night....bad thing is, I did. I had probably about 5 bites before I put it in the fridge for tomorrow. It was the only thing I ate that hub didnt. I was up ALL NIGHT long in the bathroom. Sick as a dog. The teriyaki meals are still in my fridge and I plan to call about it.  ( JUST CALLED THE PLACE) spoke with the manager. I asked for a refund on just my two meals that wouldve totalled less that $15.  My order including tip- I even tipped 8 dollars!- was $38.   I've lived in peoria all 28 years of my life, and order from this place quite frequently. I have never asked for a refund or complained before. Usually they are our GO TO for chinese take out.  Guy said no, beccause people can eat, get full,and then call for refund.    ONe of my meals had like 5 bites taken out of it (that's what got me sick) and hub didnt even touch his yet, he put it in the fridge and was saving it for today......SO I OFFERED to take the food back to them.  He said no again. I asked for higher up and than him and he said there was no higher....just the owner. I asked for the owner's info or to give him my info for contact and he refused!  He said the owner would think it was silly and would laugh at him for not being able to handle it.   I said, ok, then why isnt this handled?   He again refused to take my info and then hung up on me.   I told him I write reviews and would post to the BBB- I wanted to speak with the owner. Im not some cheapy trying to get my money back.  I have a house, two vehicles, and a small business. $15 isnt anything but principal at this point. Your food made someone sick.  I didnt ask for a full refund and I tipped MORE than what is adequate.  I WAS a good customer and now they have lost our business.            Today is mother's day.

I can best describe this resto as being a nice little upscale southern spot located in the Venetian. Definitely a place for special occasions if you're into Southern food. Thankfully a friend of mine treated me here because I was hosting him for a bit over the weekend and felt that it was necessary to do so. \n\nFried Green Tomato BLT- there was definitely a lot going on here compared to your traditional fried green tomatoes, but I assume that should be expected since everything in it was in the description. The pork belly was perfectly done and cheese pimento combine the 2 major components (pork and tomato) nicely. There was also a jam at the bottom of the tomato between the place and that made it a bit much with too many flavors going on. To top it off there was some type of greens, which added height. Although this was a very busy appetizer, my friend and I both agreed this was our favorite part of the meal.\n\nSalisbury steak- we enjoyed this dish as well. The mushrooms, shallots and gravy was delicious- to the point that they out-shined the steak itself. The steak was very ordinary, nothing special almost homemade like at your Aunt's house or something but I guess that what the other components was for. \n\nSides- biscuits, mac n cheese, and corn bread. The biscuits was very upscale flakey and were delish. I loved dipping this into the gravy of our main entree. This also came with honey butter and jam. The honey butter was good, but not as mind blowing as other southern places I've tried. Mac n cheese was a solid dish as well, which came in a mini cast iron. The corn bread was pretty moist from what I remember. \n\nAll in all the food here is a step of from your typical Southern food, but safe at the same time... I don't know if that makes sense, but if you eat here you'll know what I'm talking about. The service was of course impeccable, which is expected for a restaurant at this price point. Honestly, the food here was $3-$5 priced more than it should actually be. I'm a local so I can complain about that, but my friend who was a tourist said it's \"strip prices\" which is absolutely true.

The paneer, so traditional to Southern Indian cuisine, has a texture and taste like that of tofu.  The difference is that it is cheese, made by curdling heated milk with lemon juice and vinegar.\n\nEven the Kheer, rice pudding cooked with milk and honey, garnished with raisins and almonds, was heavenly.\n\nWith an endless supply of Dosai, thin crepe-like bread that you can use for scooping your food or rolling your dishes into, it was a excellent lunch buffet for roughly $10/person.\n\nI will definitely be coming back here for dinner, and introducing my vegetarian friends to this delightful establishment.", "funny": 2, "review_id": "d2xoJ7H-SZ7r_QDMnCftkA", "date": "2013-02-11", "user_id": "P2sQVHyHmy4WA0I7NI5hWg"}, {"business_id": "2sx52lDoiEtef7xgPCaoBw", "stars": 5, "cool": 2, "useful": 1, "text": "Yet another win for #DTLV!

I've driven by Go Wild a number of times and I've seen their ad saying 50% off all rolls, all day, every day.  I generally shy away from places that may increase prices only to offer 50% off, but after reading the Yelp reviews, I decided to give Go Wild a try.\n\nI ordered two rolls--the baked Langostino lobster on a California roll and the Kiss of Fire.  The menu describes the baked langostino roll as baked baby lobster, mushroom with dynamite sauce on Cali roll and the Kiss of Fire as Inside-Shrimp tempura, spicy shrimp, cucumber. Ouside-spicy soft shell crab, albacore, jalapeno topping, extra spicy ponzu sauce.\n\nBoth were excellent.  The presentation was great as any good sushi place should have.  The flavors of the lobster mixed with the California roll was very good.  The Kiss of Fire was aptly named.  It had spicy seasonings that gave it that kiss of fire, well a small fire.  I found that the rolls were so good the way they were that I used no soy sauce but merely used the wasabi.  I almost finished the portion they brought and almost asked for more so I could make more fire for myself.  As another reviewer said, they use a small amount of rice.  There isn't a huge amount used to make the roll look bigger than it is or to take the place of other ingredients.  \n\nI had a few more rolls on my to try list, but I decided not to pig out but stop at the two and have some dessert.  I got an order of tempura red bean ice cream.  It was a pleasant ending to a good meal.  There were three servers circulating through the restaurant that wasn't very busy.  They were attentive and even after bringing the check, asked me if I wanted another iced tea.\n\nI really liked the decor of the restaurant.  I'm not a fan of sitting at sushi bars, I've come to learn, so I sat at a table.  The music was reggae--odd for a sushi house--and the big screen TV had ESPN's Sports Nation.  It's amazing how good ESPN is when to you don't have to listen to a word of the drivel they're saying.  The TV was on mute so I watched the plays they were chatting about and tapped my feet  to the music.\n\nI'll be back and try some of the other rolls.", "funny": 0, "review_id": "19dpIYeDejoXMLSH6eDEvw", "date": "2012-05-02", "user_id": "PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q"}, {"business_id": "N42CouuodYv-yGpmuUZyew", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "text": "Unique dining experience.

After being in the public school system through 7th grade, it became apparent that public schools are not educated on helping children with Autism and Spectrum diagnoses. After years of being bullied, and getting detention for perceived \"issues\" in the public school, and being told that bullying was not tolerated, or that my son was not to blame, he continued to be punished by the school and fall through the cracks. His self-esteem was poor, his grades were falling and he became depressed.\nMy son made friends at Gateway and looked forward to going to school. The teachers and the staff care and they put the kids first. They emphasize structure and routine so the children know what to expect, and are held to high expectations when it comes to behavior and socialization. They are aiding children with Autism in learning how to be appropriate in social setting and teaching the difficult concepts of idioms, metaphors and inferences.\nGateway identifies and accommodates each child's uniqueness, and accepts the \"different learner\" as just that: learning differently. There is no bullying, there are small classrooms, and the children are taught to advocate for themselves, while the teachers work with the kids on executive functioning and daily living skills.\nMy son felt comfortable, wanted, and cared for by the staff and teachers. The teachers will go the extra mile if the parent will, and parent participation is crucial if your child is to succeed. I have never been to a school who cares more about the kids and their success. As a parent with a special needs child who is smart, funny, and tenacious. This was the place for him to be.\nI recommend Gateway Academy to all parents who feel lost in their decision on where their child \"fits in\" and where they will be cared for the way that you would if you could be home schooling your child. Gateway is involved, and the kids are happy. The staff and teachers are involved, and you will not find a better administration where the parents are partnered alongside the school to help your child succeed.", "funny": 0, "review_id": "iP8D-ZX37BixuAlb6iwBLw", "date": "2016-02-03", "user_id": "OU3b3F_JMb3ur8k8K0ASxg"}, {"business_id": "jZUJZhyc8PRvWlPKwj-arA", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "text": "Wow!

I ordered the turkey avocado wrap with edamame aioli. I was so hungry and they made this sound delicious. I was so disappointed when it arrived and had a large amount of bacon bits on it which were impossible to remove. There was no mention of bacon anywhere in the description and the bacon was a major part of the wrap. Also, I found nothing resembling avocado which was in the name. There was some sort of green paste which I can only assume was the aioli,\nbut this too was so underwhelming. I really could make a better sandwich at home. \n\nFor my second visit, I had pizza with pineapple and it was actually good so if you are forced to eat here, go with the pizza! \n\nOverall, my advice is to be cautious!

In my OpenTable reservation, I mentioned RW and the fact that I would like a seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains.\n\nSilly me. The fountains don't start up until 3pm. We did get our window seat, at least. Though I didn't check out the other side, I'm happy our table was along the window angled toward Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and the Paris balloon. The view was so enjoyable, we didn't miss the fountains at all.\n\nI suppose I should talk about the food. In a word, it was outstanding. They started us out with the amuse-bouche of the day. It was some sort of sunchoke mousse and it certainly amused my bouche. But the star of the meal for me was the beet salad. Easily the best beet salad I've ever had, the RW menu description reads, \"Spring Greens, Smoked Candy Striped, Red And Golden Beets, Fromage Blanc.\" D\u00e9licieux!\n\nNot wanting to turn this into a novel, the main course (\"Sauteed Veal Medallion, Green Pea Mousseline, Wild Forest Mushrooms\") and dessert (\"Mixed Berry Pudding, Strawberry, Blueberry, Raspberry, Framboise, Creme Fraiche\") were also fantastic. Wait a second. Framboise means raspberry. Redundant!\n\nThe wonderful setting and the fabulous food would be diminished if the service wasn't also impeccable. Our waiter knew we were there for RW and he was very knowledgeable about our meal. I chose to do the $16 wine pairing and I enjoyed his tidbit about Willamette Valley being the same latitude as the best pinot regions in France. Sure made that glass of vin taste just that much better. It was also a nice finishing touch as he brought out a selection of chocolates and candy. My choice of passion fruit jelly was delectable.\n\nHaving been to la vraie Tour Eiffel, I've been skeptical about visiting the Vegas version.

This was the one.\n\nThis was the dining experience that I was hoping for when we first stopped by here. \n\nCame by tonight and had an absolutely perfect dinner. I say perfect, because it was ab-so-fucking-lutely PERFECT. At least, for how I define perfection. Your mileage may differ. But this is Yelp, so if you're reading this far into my review, then you'd genuinely like to hear *WHY* I thought this meal was perfect.\n\nTheir patio is actually quite huge here. We were the only ones out there (I've actually never seen more than about two or three other tables here at a time- people you need to GET OUT HERE AND EAT!!!), so we sat at a nice table. Our server was very nice and attentive, friendly and prompt. We ordered the wings, the steak, and a burger. Now, on my first dining experience here I'd tried their steak, and it was fine but not *great*. One thing that really tickles my pickle about this place is the fact that the owner is genuinely passionate about her establishment, and really wants to make a go of it. She's reading these reviews and seeing what can be tweaked and fine-tuned in order to make a better meal. That, my friends, is what I wish Yelp was used for more frequently (less people bitching about Groupon and more people actually trying to give constructive ideas and experiences). She sent me a message to let me know that they were changing their steaks from ribeyes to center-cut sirloins, so of course I had to come and check it out. Well, the meal was everything that I was hoping for.\n\nFirst off, let me tell you about the wings. Their wings are FANTASTIC here. Easily my favorite this side of the Central Time Zone (Kansas City Airport Marriott presently reigns supreme with their dry-rubbed wings). They have the perfect amount of crispness, with a sauce that is ACTUALLY VERY TASTY! And the dipping sauce that they come with (which is, of course, handmade, as is everything here) perfectly compliments the wing sauce that they're tossed in. You just have to try them. Seriously. You *HAVE* to try them. \n\nThe burger was outstanding, reminiscent of a perfectly-prepared hotel burger from a Westin which would cost twice as much. They listened to our previous reviews, and they've made a few tweaks here and there... FOLKS, THEIR BURGERS ARE EASILY AS GOOD AS THE ONES FROM THE GROVES (and maybe... better...???). The french fries are perfectly crisp but soft on the inside. Delicious.\n\nAnd the steak... the steak was exactly what I was hoping for. I'm on a bit of a red meat kick lately, so I've had my share of great steaks lately. This was definitely one of the better ones. The au jus which came with it was a perfect accompaniment- light and definitely not overpowering, a perfect companion to the meat.\n\nThe beers were also great. Great selection, and great recommendations. I'd type more and get into more details, but honestly right now I'm just blissfully stuffed and I want you to stop reading and start driving your ass on over to MJaye's. They're trying to offer you some great food, so the least that you can do is to give them the opportunity to win you over.", "funny": 2, "review_id": "iwEBDR0v7HzGDHL3iM567Q", "date": "2015-11-09", "user_id": "tBANVdxh_if10BXv6YsLmg"}, {"business_id": "DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A", "stars": 2, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "text": "Went here just to play bingo.  \nThe lady's calling numbers is quick and sometimes hard to hear.

There are a dozen or so lagers and stouts from the far east. I ordered the Singha Thai lager, and my comrades had some pretty interesting stouts from Japan. Most sushi bars will only carry Kirin Ichiban, Sapporo, and maybe Tsingtao, so the diversity is welcome. Also, the cocktails are worth a try.

We had already been to Carly's, Lucky Strike, Roosevelt, Bikini, Paisley Violin, and Lost Leaf. It was a perfectly fine drunken evening. Riding by District, I said hi to three women smoking on the patio. They said hi back, and I thought that was it. 1/2 block later, I look back and my friend is not anywhere to be seen. He made convo with the three, and scored one of their numbers. SWEET! Well, an hour of talking to them and he had an open invitation for us to join them for Chris Isakk... I wasn't feeling it though. It's just Chris Isakk, and I can't drive, and the train doesn't go there, and a taxi costs too much.... the only option is to bike! it's almost four miles!! So we biked, and biked, and biked. \n\nFinally, after the most awkwardly drunken bike ride down roosevelt for several miles, we arrived to a full parking lot and no idea where to go or how to get in. This place has no signage about which entrance is what. I go to lock my bike to a fence and the girl at the door says I cannot do that here. When I asked where I could lock it up, she replied \"sir, I make $5.75 an hour.\" Ok, cool, but where can I lock my bike up? She said I could lock it to a light pole, so I started to do that, then she said \"not that light pole sir. I make $5.75 an hour please don't make my job hard.\" I don't care how much you make. This wen't on for 10 minutes. Then trying to get into the place was next to impossible. We couldn't get close enough to the door to exchange tickets with our contact, and she couldn't go out the door because they have a no-reentry policy. Eventually some young girl with authority told us it was our lucky day and we could both go in for free... YESSSSSS! My sweet brunette savior. \n\nInside the venue, everything goes in a circle, and is very intimate. There really isn't a bad seat in the house. The stage rotates so everyone gets a good view for half the show. They have plenty of concession stands, and $7 a beer is at least better than Chase Field, US Airways Center, or Dodge. The ride back home consisted of singing Chris Isakk songs and screaming and yelling all the way down Washington back downtown.

This replica does a good job of giving those a German experience who do not or cannot go all the way to Germany for the real thing. They spent a lot of money inside to cave the ceiling similar to the one in Germany, the music is mostly German bands who have been contracted and play authentic German music, and the beer has been imported from Germany as well. The beer is very good, however some people judge because it is not made in house, but that would also require a brewery so it is understandable.\n\nThe food also seems to be mostly imported from Germany, like specific sausages and the sauerkraut. My favorite are the Nuremberger sausages with mashed potatoes and the  obatzter cheese appetizer. Both super German and excellent dishes. I also know a lot of people who ordered the Wurstplatte, a variety of German sausages on one plate. Great for big meat eaters and hungry patrons. \n\nAs for the ambiance, think loud, group style seating, would not suggest this for a date place or quiet night out. This is a girls/guys group night out, bachelor party type loud and craziness can sometimes go on here. Tons of tourists come here  as well, and they are usually young people wanting to drink and get spanked or old Germans trying out their known cuisine. \n\nDon't go to this place for the service or food, it is all about the ambiance here. Sitting next to and conversing with strangers from wherever, drinking real German beer, and listening to a German band play super loud music echoing in the beer hall. If you want to check it out but are afraid to sit in the big open loud hall you can always retreat to the beer garden which is enclosed in the back part of the Hofbrauhouse and is usually quieter.

The dessert of rhubarb crisp was not the best.

I recently attended the news emmys here. On the positive the service was very good. Bathroom facilities were spotless and the venue is nice with a cool historic touch. The food was absolutely excellent which is an important thing to note as many banquet facilities lack quality in food. The prime rib melted in my mouth and I don't even like prime rib but this was amazing. All of the food had an incredible amount of flavor. The room set  up worked but the one thing that everyone was complaining about all night long was the humidity and temperature. It was incredibly hot and way too crowded in the pre-function space where we had our cocktail hour. Seriously, you could barely move. As we all moved into the banquet space, everyone was dripping and started to use their programs as fans. I asked the server to turn the air on, and I think he did, but it was still a bit stuffy in there. Afterwards, the aquarium area as well was super hot and very humid. I can understand the limitations of being an old building, but something like this has to be fixed. I got married in a very old building, but the temperature was fine because the owners rehabbed the system to make sure that no bride would melt in her dress. If I had my wedding there last Saturday, I would have been furious if it was that hot, although part of me wonders if the wedding area cranked the AC and stole all the cold air from us. I don't know.

We were anticipating a fun girls night that was a happy blend of gin tonics and great music so that we could unwind from a busy work week. I checked Blnd Tger out online and chose to ignore the warnings of past posted reviews. Let's face it, in this day in age, everyone thinks their opinion is valid on the World Wide Web. I just like to have my own.\nWe roll up, there is no line out in front and we are good to stroll right in. But before we do, bouncers gotta check us out to see that we own proper identification and not trying to sneak in contraband. Not a problem until... there was a problem. \nMy friend got checked first and we watched in awe as one of the bouncers was rummaging through in almost of a fisting type motion. A flashlight into the bag would have helped screen the contents of the bag, but that's just my personal opinion. Another bouncer ushered me towards her so that I could begin my bag check, so I shuffled aside and willingly held my purse open. Now don't get me wrong, I know that this checkpoint is a critical measure in venue security, but this was not your usual, \"pat down and bag inspection\" like in the good ol' days. I held my purse steady as she checked every nook and cranny. She opened up my cigarette pack, checked the side zipper pockets, rummaged around the bottom to make sure nothing was over looked, the usual stuff. Then I watched her take out my wallet, open it up, looked flipped through the contents inside and take out a package of Zig Zags that was buried behind some store gift cards. Then she closed everything up placed my wallet inside my purse, but kept the papers in her hand. Apparently, I am able to cross international boarders with rolling papers, but not the threshold of this venue. At this point I had to ask \"Are you really taking my papers away from me?\" She indeed was. \nBehind me, my friend, who had passed her body examination, had experienced a pat down that would have gotten her boyfriend into jealous fit. Lets just say it was the kinda frisking that would make ol skool rapper MC Hammer say \"Can't Touch This\".\nTo sum this up, my bouncer told me I could not take my Ziggys into the venue, so I chose to keep my compressed tree pulp package and not go in on principle. In my entire adult life of heading out and about, I have never come across security procedures like I did that night. Made me think just what kind of a place I was potentially stepping into. Where girls are touched and groped at the doors of a club and where paper is as dangerous as a crack pipe.\nOur night was not at a loss however. There are a multitude of bars and venues on College St. that have excellent service, good music and gin and tonics. I'd be very surprised if I saw this place still up and running on my next visit to College, but that's just my opinion.
