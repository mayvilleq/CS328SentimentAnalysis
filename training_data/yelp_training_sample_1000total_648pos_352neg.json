Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed \"diner\" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.\n\nStarting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.\n\nThe menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is \"Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50),\" and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!\n\nWe went with the \"Bambamburger ($11.50),\" which is 2/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the \"Bambamburger,\" and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.\n\nBamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.\n\nIf you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.", "stars": 4, "cool": 3, "useful": 8, "date": "2011-08-01"}, {"user_id": "dQzQ4bN0Rnb8M-0LqTl3-g", "review_id": "AR_IDHl2P4kUVPB_tTsA6w", "funny": 0, "business_id": "bvGdqJ-SeGdIHX-HEabwlg", "text": "I went there a couple week ago.

I was especially partial to the GF butter tart.\n\nFriendly service, and great interior design. I loved the overhead lights - they're freaking lamps made from giant beaters, plus every table had fresh flowers on it. One word sums this place up -  adorable. (In two words - adorably delicious.) I love the random jars with stuff in it aesthetic. Lots of greens and neutral tones.\n\nAlso - wifi.Free functional wifi.

I urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as I got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn't clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt \"oops\" then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut. Next I told her I wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as I'm watching her file my nails I have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval. After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say \"that's not almond\" uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says \"hurry up\" now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies \"oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though\" can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right.

DO NOT use this company!  An estate sale is usually held at a time of stress, death, or moving to a retirement home, when you are vulnerable. That was not my situation, but she CANNOT BE TRUSTED with your family belongings!  Both houses were complete turn-key rentals with all furniture, d\u00e9cor, household goods, linens, etc.  Some of the items were exquisite, especially compared to the other sales shown on her website. There was a mix of things and various quality and values.  I had already conducted three of my own estate sales for other vacation homes that my company was emptying out, and I didn't have time to do another sale. I made a lot of money at my own sales, and I know what stuff sells and what doesn't.  I am also an avid estate/garage sale shopper, so I do know prices. I was going out of town, so I thought this was a great idea - WRONG!  I feel scammed and robbed.  So many things went wrong -- I can't possibly list them all here.  Numerous people told me later that they had been at the sale and said it was very disorganized, nothing was priced, she was on the phone all the time, was just stuffing money into her overalls and not accounting for anything at all!  She doesn't say what she sold major items for (even though I had set minimum prices), provides no accounting whatsoever, and she brought over a lot of her own JUNK to sell.  I think she keeps stuff left over from other sales  (she says she donates it), and then she sells it and pockets the money herself, mixing up the funds of her clients.  Damage was done to both houses from people moving furniture, the carpets were filthy, and items were stolen, including a fixture from the shower!  There were only 3 people working both houses and she had told me there would be 5 -- 2 people at each house, plus herself.  How else could you make sure people weren't stealing stuff, if there is no one there watching?!  Something doesn't add up about this company, and I cannot believe she is still in business.

It seemed that any time we wanted to order (drinks, entrees, and dessert), we had to wait for a fairly long time for our server to notice us. However cleaning up plates was very efficient. \n\nWe also had problems with the restaurant running out of items we wanted. One person in the party ordered their ravioli and was told upon ordering that they were out of it. It really bothers me when restaurants don't tell you up front what they don't have in stock anymore. Otherwise you are happy with your choice and then need to make a split decision because the restaurant doesn't have it.  Two of us were also drinking Coke Zero and they ran out of that half way through the meal too. \n\nIn terms of the food, I've been to this restaurant a few years ago and remember the food being better than this visit. I had the wild cheese tortellini and found it to be a bit bland. My husband had the bolognese which I also found to be a bit bland.

However, people usually go for their cold noodles. They also feature an extensive list of Sundae (\"soon-deh\") dishes, which is Korean sausage made with pig organs and intestines. Observing the other tables, I noted that it wasn't as popular as Naeng Myeon. However, keep in mind that it was a hot summer evening and the cold noodles are just that good. I personally like Sundae (spelling it like that is making me want ice cream...argh. I better switch to Soondae), and encourage you to try it!\n\nChik Bibim Naeng Myeon (Thin arrowroot noodles with a special sauce)\nWin!\nThis was perfect for the hot day. The slushy broth, cooling veggies, chilled arrowroot noodles, and sliced hard-boiled egg made this the most satisfying bowl of noodles that I've had in Toronto. I chowed until all that was left was a puddle of the \"special spicy sauce\" which I loved. From what I observed, it's essentially hot pepper paste (gochu-jang), hot pepper flakes, and probably a bit of soy & minced garlic.\nThe slurried broth kept the dish chilled while I ate through my mother's plate of Tang Soo Yuk. My father and I shared dumplings & short ribs.\nAnyways, I can quite honestly say that this was the best bowl of cold noodles that I've had to date, rivalling South Korea. While it may seem backwards to eat spicy food when it's hot, it was super satisfying and it didn't make me feel hotter at all.\nNot a fan of spicy food? They offer Mul Naeng Myeon, which is essentially the same thing but without the spicy sauce (but that's what makes this so good, so please...get the bibim!!). It comes with seasonal fruit - watermelon was being served tonight. I like watermelon, but I love spice.\nI also like squirting hot mustard all over my noodles. You can also add vinegar, but I don't like it in my Naeng Myeon.\n\nTang Soo Yuk (Korean-style Chinese dish. Sweet & Sour Pork)\nSoggy :(\nA childhood favourite of mine, this is an example of Korean-style Chinese cuisine. There are many dishes that you'll find in Korean restaurant under this niche - Jajamyeon (black bean noodles) is another popular example. Sticky-sweet, when it's done right the deep-fried pork, chicken, or beef has super crispy batter and is tender on the inside with a generous helping of sugary syrup, vegetables and fruit. Unfortunately, this was not done right. It was squishy, not crispy, which pretty much ruined the dish. Boo.\n\nKalbi (Grilled, marinated beef short ribs)\nSkip this...\nI've had better - much better. I am a bit of snob since I often make my own short ribs, but since I don't have a grill I like ordering them from restaurants. The cut of meat tasted low grade and fatty, and the flavour was lacking from the missing green onions. Moving on.\n\nMandu (dumplings Available fried or steamed)\nDeep fried goodness!\nAnother dish that I often make on my own, I still like to order these in restaurants since I never deep-fry them at home. I was pleased with these, and I would order them again with my noodles over the kalbi any day!\n\nI was a little frustrated with the service, but it was super-busy so I wasn't upset. The servers were rushing between tables, so they definitely weren't slacking. I was simply anxious to get my banchan because I was super hungry and jealously watching other tables get theirs while we were a little forgotten...even though we were right in front of the kitchen. Oddly, we received our mandu (dumplings) and kalbi (short ribs) before our banchan but again, they were under quite a bit of pressure so I didn't complain. We were also not given a box of cutlery, and it was hard to wave a server down. Needing something to eat the food on our table, I leaned over and swiped a box from another table.\n\nCho Sun Ok!", "stars": 5, "cool": 3, "useful": 3, "date": "2010-09-16"}, {"user_id": "WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA", "review_id": "sX9nxrq6gkIZhwyVdyNrKg", "funny": 1, "business_id": "uP2-0N59oW5lggIyvdfWkQ", "text": "Located behind Pacific Mall, Chung King Garden serves an excellent full-course Peking Duck in record time.

I was really pleased with the beef; it had great flavour from the chili and it wasn't drenched in sauce so it stayed crispy. Shredded carrots and green onions added to the flavour, and it was great with rice.\n\nAuthentic Beijing Roast Duck (3 Courses) ($37.95)\n1. Crispy Duck Skin & Breast\n2. Duck Stir Fry\n3. Duck Soup\n\nCourse 1: Crispy, Roasted Skin\nI could hardly contain my excitement when the first course arrived. The dark skin was shining and crispy-looking, with duck breast peeking out from underneath.The flavour was fantastic. There was also little to no fat hiding between the skin and breast, which but they've rendered it so well that it was still moist.\nWith it came steamed dry crepes to wrap the roasted duck, vegetables, tian mian jian (a savoury-sweet bean sauce), and crispy shrimp crackers. The crepes are nice and thin, but thick enough to wrap everything without breaking before shoving it into your mouth. Eat the crackers while they're super-fresh and hot - like pork rinds, they get soft and blah over time.\n\nCourse 2: Minced, Fried Duck in Lettuce Wraps\nThere were also bits of crispy white noodles hidden among the pile of stir fried duck, vegetables, and saucey goodness. The sweet bean sauce is a great base for stir fries, and II enjoyed tofu, water chestnuts, pepper, carrots, onion, and whatever other vegetables were in the mix. There was just enough to give it flavour, and they clearly weren't just \"fillers\" for the dish to look bigger.\nWe eagerly grabbed spoonfuls and scooped the duck into pieces iceberg lettuce. I also enjoyed it with white rice when we ran out of lettuce. Win.\n\nCourse 3: Duck Soup\nLast to arrive was a soup made from the remaining skin, meat, and bones. The broth was surprisingly light and tasty - not at all oily! A friend said this was her favourite course for this very reason. I really wonder what they put in this broth to make it so flavourful in such a short amount of time. Tofu, duck, and nappa cabbage was plentiful and we cleaned this bowl up without a problem.

I am a regular Zara Customer having shopped in Chicago, California, and Arizona locations for 8 years now.  This evening, I was shopping in the store for a total of 20 minutes from start to finish.  From the moment I walked trough the door this evening, not one sales associate said a word to me.  No one helped us!  My daughter and I made quick selections for her to try on because we needed something specific, and she headed towards the dressing room.  It was 8:57 at that moment, when the cashier, Maria Marte, was the first person in the entire time I was there to say anything to me.  Here is what she said, \"We are closed.\"  I replied, \"Its 3 minutes to closing, you aren't closed yet, my daughter wants to try 3 blouses on, and then we should be able to make a purchase quickly.\"  The cashier at Zara, Fashion Square replied to me, \"Well I'm closing my register.\"  \n\nAt 9:02 pm, the cashier Maria Marte turned to me and said, \"I'm closing my register.\".  I said in return, \"We are going to make a purchase, my daughter is finishing up in the dressing room.\"  Where in she stated, \"Well we are closed.\"  I said, \"You won't let us make a purchase?\"  Maria the cashier then said, \"Well my manager said to go ahead and close my register.\"  I asked to speak to the store manager, because this didn't seem right. It was no way to treat a customer who is trying to make a purchase at 2 minutes after 9:00 pm\n\nAt that moment, the assistant store manager came over to us.  His name is Ruben Sanchez.  Ruben turned to me and said, \"We are closed.\"  I said, I realize this, but we are about to make a purchase.  He then said, \"Well our registers are closing.\"  I looked at my watch and said, \"It's 4 minutes after, won't you give us some grace and let us make a purchase?\"  Ruben the assistant store manager at the Scottsdale, AZ store turned to the cashier and said, \"Close it down.\"  Then walked away from me.  I said to Maria the Cashier, \"I come 9 years out of Retail Sales, and have worked for Nordstrom and Barney's New York.  This is never an attitude that a sales associate should have towards a customer that would like to make a purchase.  Generally, at 9:00 pm closing you close the front door, but let any customers still in the store at that time finish out their transaction, make the purchase, then allow them to leave.  This is within a reasonable amount of time, it's 9:06 now.\"  Maria the cashier then said, \"Well my manager told me to close the register.\"  I replied, \"Even if that means you won't allow me to make a purchase.\"  She said, \"Yes.\"  After begging them to take my money, I finalized my transaction at 9;06 pm, with purchasing a white blouse my daughter had selected.

I asked the waiter to at least bring me some water (I was super dehydrated already) and...NOTHING!!! Finally, at the end of the movie, we complained to the waiter and he said he would get a manager.

I don't do these often, as it is not in the family budget, so I was looking forward to it. And the place looked nice and shiny inside. Well, I was completely disappointed with the results. First, the pedi.The \"spa pedi\" I asked for didn't include the removal of dead skin cells with the razor or other scraping tool. The woman gave my feet a quick 10 second brush with a pink pumice and then on to the \"massage\" she prided herself on, which lasted for a whole 60 seconds at best and was nothing special. That was a huge disappointment, as this is one of the parts of a pedicure it's hard to pull off at home. I am prone to having ingrowns, so I was VERY specific that the woman should cut straight across for the pedi, leaving the corners alone! Well, she cut the nails straight across, but then she got fierce with the nail nipper. Before I even knew what she was doing, she had cut at a diagonal on the corners of one of my big toes. Worse, when I got home, I realized that she had actually visibly CUT the cuticle on the side of that same toe, further down. And I had to treat it with antibacterial ointment for several days before the pain and swelling subsided. Also, I noticed that the tools she used seem to be in her own personal toolbox, which was fine, but I have no idea if they were floating around in water or in some sort of antibacterial solution. I am praying it was the latter. [Note to self: next time look for a place that assigns you your own set of tools and stores them for you or clearly shows you how their tools are kept clean] As for the shellac mani, the woman piled on so much and so many layers of polish that it looked and felt as if I was actually wearing fake nails! And the so-called \"2 weeks at least\" shellac manicure lasted a whole of four days before the shellac bubbled at the edges and began coming off of the nails in large swathes.

There seems to be some negative buzz surrounding this place. Most of the stuff I read made it seem like there wasn't any shot of much good coming out of it. So, imagine my surprise when the food was good, the service was attentive, and the overall experience was one that I'd come back for.\n\nIn all fairness, a lot of that negative stuff I read was about their Theatre district location on King West, which I've neer been to, but that just doesn't hold much value for me. The fact is, most of those places on that strip of King seem to get a bad rap. Get 'em in, get 'em fed, get 'em out; that's their philosophy as they wait for theatre goers to arrive, and then again when they hope for them to come back after the show... thankfully, Hey Lucy's Annex location isn't anything like that.\n\nWith their soft lighting, chandeliers and black-and-white cow print seats, it's difficult to describe what exactly they were going for when they designed this place, but somehow, it works well and provides a nice backdrop, particularly for a date night. The ambience is hip, the decor is comfortable and cozy, and the space is of a decent enough size that it can easily accommodate both large groups and couples.\n\nHey Lucy is busy in the summer evenings, mostly because of their killer patio that lines the entire side of the building. Perfect for people-watching, this packed space is a nice addition to The Annex, and it holds up well against other patios on the street (except for Pauper's Pub!).\n\nProbably what Hey Lucy is most well-known for is their martinis. They've got a pretty decent martini menu with some interesting things on it, like the Godzilla and the Freedom 55, but man, these guys are expensive. Although they do come with a minimum of 2 ounces of booze, you can expect to shell out 9 bucks plus taxes for one. And while that may seem ok at first, having a few of them can easily add up... trust me on that. If martinis are your thing, but getting ripped off for them isn't, then you're definitely going to want to come back on a Wednesday. Wednesday is Martini Wednesday at Hey Lucy, and the prices drop to 4 bucks for the exact same martinis. But come early, other people like a good deal when they see one too, and this place fills up pretty quickly.\n\nTheir menu doesn't follow any sort of style; it's a bit all over the place, but it's still the sorta thing you might expect from a place like this. Pastas, wood-fired pizzas, paninis, sandwiches, all of it is pretty good, but unfortunately, this can unexpectedly change once the place fills up. In Hey Lucy's case, it's better to go when it isn't that busy.\n\nWhile I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Hey Lucy, if you're in the area and looking for a night out, Hey Lucy provides nicely.", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2011-09-24"}, {"user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "review_id": "HPrS6nbMQEYrnBPKe7KlMQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "ghaj1MZzPW1qXYCZWfoTTw", "text": "\"So, are you going to eat a steak first?\"\"You might want to sneak some meat in with you.\"\"Enjoy your...vegetables.\"\n\nThese were not uncommon responses from folks when I said I'd be heading to Live Food Bar. I too was skeptical but went along for the ride anyways when a friend suggested we go. While perusing the online menu, I was genuinely stumped as to what I would get. I already eat at least one - but generally several - vegetarian meals a week, so I'm not opposed to eating a meal with no meat. But Live is a vegan, organic restaurant that features recipes without gluten, without sugar and certainly without any animal products which is outside my culinary experience. If you happen to feel the same way, I suggest you go with an open mind as Live has an excellent reputation and it is well earned. \n\nI settled in to the table at the front, which has a great view of the world walking by, of the bright, cheerful restaurant. While I waited for my dining companions, I had a look through the drink list and eventually settled on a bottle Mill Street Organic. (Should I come back in the summer, I will definitely sample the cocktails on the lovely patio!) When the ladies arrived, we ordered a bottle of organic cabernet sauvignon and started going over the menu for the millionth time. It is an extensive list with dishes that should appeal to just about all diners. Appetizers, salads, bowls, mains, pasta, dessert: Live certainly does not lack for choice. The three of us agreed that we wanted to try the chick pea fries, so we ordered those while attempting to make a decision.\n\nFinally, we made our choices: raw sushi with pumpkin & sunflower seed nori rolls and a detox salad; \"Bacon Cheese\" burger; and tempeh cakes with a warm corn, avocado and white wine salsa. Orders placed, we tucked into our wine and the chick pea fries which arrived shortly thereafter. Crispy on the outside, piping hot and soft on the inside, this non-traditional take on a staple hit the spot, especially with the homemade BBQ sauce on the side.\n\nOur mains arrived in a timely manner, and we hungrily tucked in to them. The sushi roll had a great combination of flavour and texture. I was a little jealous of not ordering that one for myself, but my giant plate of food was more than enough. The tempeh (an Indonesian soybean product) cakes were piled high on top of the wonderful salsa that was accompanied by a spicy chipotle aioli. If you're hungry, get this dish. It was undoubtedly for the best that I did not order an appetizer, as well as the cakes and sides were so surprisingly good that I was nearly scraping my plate. \n\nAs for the \"cheese bacon\" burger, it passed the taste test. The patty consisted of chick peas and had macadamia cheddar \"cheese\" and eggplant \"bacon.\" I can see your eyebrows raising. The eggplant had a smoky flavour and was quite good, though certainly not bacon. The cheese in question was a bit of a head-scratcher, though not unpleasant. The gluten-free bun was nicely toasted and the BBQ sauce was a great touch.\n\nSince we had already gone through much of the menu, we thought we should give dessert a whirl. All the desserts are kept on display in near the back of the restaurant, and there is quite an array from which to choose. We opted for two: the tiramisu and the Black Forrest cake. Now, my Italian friends would be horrified to find a tiramisu without real cream, but it really was quite good with a strong, but not overpowering, taste of espresso. Similarly, the Black Forrest cake was rich, creamy and cut nicely with the cherries on top. No complaints - I certainly didn't feel like I was missing out.\n\nLive has a great vibe to it and customers were constantly arriving either to have a seated meal or to pick up their take-out orders. The music is at just the right volume and the staff is friendly and accommodating. We were there for several hours and never felt rushed, nor got the idea that we were no longer welcome. Food arrives promptly and with a smile, water bottles are refilled, and the service is relaxed. So take your vegetarian friends, take your carnivorous friends: they will likely all be satisfied.

It's worked out fine each Saturday that I've gone and I've definitely left happy with a full tummy. \n\nThough I haven't tried their pastries and desserts, they look amazing. Sunflower even has a number of vegan desserts, you're into that kinda thing. They do have a full coffee and tea bar.

Short of going to a top Italian restaurant, this is it ... Real Italian flavor with top quality ingredients.  You can purchase frozen entrees, appetizers, and side dishes as well as fresh pasta and sauces.  If you zip home before the family or guests arrive and put it in your own cookware for heating, the house will smell amazing and they'll think you are a professional cook.  The store is owned and operated by family and a lot of love goes into everything they make.  The fresh pasta is what separates their products from the rest...it is outstanding.  Unlike the reviewer who rated it a three without tasting the products, I have sampled most products and they have all been excellent.  Anyone I've sent there (many), have been equally impressed.

Side note: our first excellent experience included the tasting menu. He ordered the four course, while I ordered a salad and entree.  His four courses were full of delicious food that was enough to feed us both.  Neither of us were able to finish our meals, and we left full and happy!  But tonight, our tasting menu options and delivery were beyond disappointing.\n\nWe decided to sit at the bar tonight.  When we sat down we were eyed down by the female bartender who reluctantly took our order.  She didn't bother to tell us the specials, which we later overheard her share with other customers, and she didn't ask if we were interested in any food.  Before we were finished with our drinks, she brought over our check; were we being rushed out of this NOT crowded bar?  I had a bad feeling, and I wish I would have trusted my gut to leave.  We asked her for another round and let her know we were going to order dinner and had a groupon.\n\nOur service was bad before we told her we had a groupon, and it only spiraled down from there.  But bad service I can handle, it was the food that made me jump onto yelp!  The tasting menu was for family style service so we had to pick the same four items for dinner.  Family style?  This is different than last time, I thought.... Our first course was a variety of meats, cheeses, and olives.  It was a much smaller portion than he had during our first visit to elements, but who needs to over eat meat and cheese anyway?  The second course was a beat and goat cheese salad.  The salad was large and more than enough for two people (aka filler).  When our entree arrived I almost fell off of my barstool.  There was one filet of salmon for the two of us to share.  It wasn't a monstrous sized salmon as big as my head, it wasn't two of my fists, it was a small piece of salmon meant to feed both of us.  I am mortified that I didn't call attention to this at the restaurant, but I couldn't believe that I had been served a 'family style' portion of salmon that included only one piece of fish.  WHAT?  Dessert wasn't memorable, but what I do remember is not being asked if I wanted coffee to accompany it either.\n\nI'm not even mentioning in detail the bartender's awkward comments that we cleaned our plates during our meal or that another bartender knocked over my glass of wine. Please, don't go to elements.  There are too many better restaurants in Pittsburgh to waste anymore thought on this dump.\n\n\nNote to restaurants: If you don't like people who use groupons, then please don't invite us into your restaurant only to treat us poorly. Like I said earlier, this was our third visit to Elements.  We bought the groupon because we were repeat customers, we liked the restaurant, and now we will never go back.\n\n**UPDATE**\nI followed up with Groupon and Elements.  Groupon refunded our money with no problem at all.  When I called Elements, they said the owner wanted to speak to me after reading my review on yelp, but he wasn't available.  He called me back once, and I returned the call.

It was worth walking past a few Starbucks shops on the way here! It is literally written on their walls how they value making coffee right here (there's cool chalk drawings of the differences between different types of orders, TVs showing the farming process, etc). \n\nThe shop is really clean and rather spacious. It's a nice place to even study, have a conversation, or just meet, with outdoor seating as well if you really wanna. It's currently nicely air conditioned indoors, well furnished with tables, and for the jusr 3 times I've been around they've played a nice variety of music.\n\nAfter all I've said about crafting a cup of coffee well, I'll say it was amusing watching another customer complain outloud, asking what was going on today, and how her \"furtado isn't even hot enough\" ^_^ ... What is to note though is how they handled it. They were generous enough to make another one, and just maintained courteous service pretty much. Besides that they've just been the nicest people so far, nice to talk to.\n\nBonus support: Bruxie is pretty close by, if you want a more filling waffle & chicken meal first.

The employees and owner all live up to the name and their mission. The owner came by to check out my situation the next day after I contacted Honest Pool Care. He was very eager to check it out, as he was concerned about the problem becoming worse if we waited too long. He was very thorough during his visit. He wasn't there for the full hour. Therefore, he had no interest in charging me for the full hour visit. He gladly reduced the price for me. Awesome! He could have very easily charged me full price as he was there for more than 30 minutes. He told me what he thinks might be the root of the issue but stressed he would talk it over with some repair techs to be sure and to avoid unnecessary costs and repairs. After discussing with his crew, he called me to inform me of their findings the following day. I love that this company is on top of things! Regretfully, I was a former Poolman customer. Dealing with that company is like pulling teeth. It takes a week just to talk about an issue with that awful company.  He was honest and told me what he had initially thought was the issue, no longer seems to be an issue at all. He explained to me what was going on and offered me options to fix this problem.  I appreciate that as well because he could have easily taken advantage and  only offer one solution...one where his company would profit. Experiencing this level of great customer service helps to ease my nervous attitude toward this situation. Also, I must note that I live in South Phoenix. I called multiple pool companies that claim they service Phoenix and surrounding areas. However, none of them were willing to come this far south. Honest Pool Care, according to this site, services Tempe and surrounding areas. This company is willing to come to this area.

The place has a real old rustic feel to it, almost like you're standing in your grandma's kitchen. This is achieved by the thick wooden rusty tables and the wooden cabinet littered with books and interesting knickknacks.  The kitchen is an open one with a floral pattern dress wearing chef cooking frantically behind it. We were a bit put off that she wasn't wearing a hair net but let it slide. One thing I liked though was that this place had proper ventilation, so you don't leave smelling like the food as was the case at Mitzi's Caf\u00e9. We also loved that it was hidden in a nice, quiet residential area, always a favorite!  \n\nWe noticed that there was only one server on duty, which made the service less than impressive, but god bless her she was doing her very best. You couldn't really blame the server for this but instead the management for allowing one server on duty on a busy Sunday afternoon (the place was packed). Once seated we were served water right away and asked about our beverage orders to which we all said we'd have coffee. The coffee was the best damn coffee I've ever had in my life! And I've tried various kinds in my day between living in Europe and here. I even went to the trouble of taking down the name of the brand. As the service was quite slow, we had to re-fill our own coffee cups from the coffee station as well as our own water, which actually made the whole brunch experience more interactive as you almost felt like you were in a friend's kitchen helping yourself.  \n\nI ordered the salmon/goat cheese breakfast wrap ($11), while the rest of the table ordered their own choices (all different). I have to comment on the freshly cut Paeonia arrangement in the middle of the table, my friend and I couldn't stop sticking our noses into them. The washroom was quite small but clean. Our meals came out 45 minutes after ordering but were delicious! The goat cheese complimented the salmon extraordinarily well; I was surprised at myself that I've never tried this type of pairing before. The rest of my table also expressed like for their meals. I was a bit disappointed though with the bland salad on the side. Although the leaves were all very rich in color, the dressing was nothing special.\n\nThe total bill for the two of us was $35. Even though the service wasn't the best, I would still give this place four stars, for the effort put in by the server in doing her gosh darn best, for the amazing food, for the ambiance and for the general feel of the place. \n\nA definite place to return to, but perhaps a bit earlier next time.", "stars": 4, "cool": 4, "useful": 4, "date": "2011-06-16"}, {"user_id": "MGU_MeGj51wBjhD0T8vUgA", "review_id": "9XjrAFKs3AjRF25At6J5qA", "funny": 1, "business_id": "VSgrQWkpv15FJuqmNE3srg", "text": "After reading some great things about this place, myself and my boyfriend decided to check it out one Friday morning. I'm also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future, so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research. \n\nIt helped that before we entered, there was a sign on the door up front saying that they only accepted cash, a bit of a nuisance, but better to know before you go in than after you've eaten your meal.\n\nMy first impression was it was very buzzy, great music playing and beautiful art work on the wall for sale to keep your attention. After putting our name down on the waiting list and waiting 20 minutes for a table (we played the cross-word while we waited) we were seated next to the kitchen, which is an open one.\n\nThe service was friendly and fast, although the table we were sitting at was a bit small. You can choose from ordering off their menu or from the blackboard above the cafe area. I found that the menu was a bit more simple to follow, whereas the board was a bit too confusing.\n\nWe both ordered the Mitzi's Breakfast Special ($6.95), coffee and a large glass of OJ (freshly squeezed, $4). We also found that sausage is not served here, but bacon instead. When asked why this was, the waitress simply said that they prefer to carry one type of meat. \n\nThe wait was about 15 minutes for our food, but the art work on the wall kept us entertained. The food was absolutely delicious!! Where do I begin? The roasted potatoes, mmmmmm, nothing like I've ever had before. Roasted in some kind of pasta sauce with a hint of vinegar. When I asked the waitress for the recipe, she kindly said that it was a Mitzi's special and that it cannot be shared, smart girl! The bacon was oh so good with a hint of smokiness to it. The toast was pre-buttered (nice!) and our poached eggs were just right. And for $6.95, what a deal!! $24 total bill.\n\nThe only draw back to this place was the lack of ventilation. Because the kitchen is an open one, it got pretty warm and the faint smell of the cooking was left in our hair and clothes. \n\nAll in all, a really great place with delicious, reasonably priced food!

We ordered etouffee, boudin, jambalaya, fried green tomatoes, gumbo, a shrimp po boy, and beignets.  Each dish was a perfect example of fine New Orleans fare. Their remoulade is some of the best I've ever had and even their fries are exceptional. The service was perfect, which is all the more remarkable for a restaurant that just had their grand opening.  We met the charming owner and he took the time to tell us all about the place.  He's a true ambassador of Southern Hospitality that is oft hard to come by in the West.", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2017-12-26"}, {"user_id": "LwgExnxUPg6Beyn7JRVAvA", "review_id": "_cz6uLmSQ0N6JCZHookAdg", "funny": 0, "business_id": "vUhxuFgKCZn6cTZePbhd6g", "text": "This is easily my favorite Starbucks in Charlotte so far.

The staff are friendly and they do a great job with the drinks.\n\nIt's also the most unique Starbucks I've ever been in.

I don't think Starbucks intended people use the floor outlets; I think they were just there previously before the Starbucks moved in. The wall outlets work great. \n\nIt's a busy location, just so you know. You can expect a little delay in your drink but that happens with the business.\n\nThey don't have a drive thru as there's no space for one here. That's not a big deal for me, however, because I take the bus anyway. Public transit is pretty good in Charlotte, though it does tend to run a bit later than scheduled. But buses run late at night as well as the light rail. I would recommend getting to this Starbucks via public transportation just because the parking looks like it could be a little crazy. It's not far from the East/West Blvd Lynx light rail station and it's just one bus ride away, just take route 25 there. \n\nI still want to check out the Steele Creek Starbucks as I've heard good things about it but I think the East Blvd Starbucks will be my regular Starbucks from this point on.", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2014-07-23"}, {"user_id": "BXM-uWnlcJhjd-ye5okOKA", "review_id": "TChbRrPPToktohK9Iz4pyg", "funny": 0, "business_id": "k2b3niokS_tosjah_rzCPw", "text": "Best pizza in the north west area,if you like pizza from NY or NJ.

After hearing great things from fellow students, I decided to drop in to get my ears pierced. \n\nI had had my ears pierced previously, but they closed up because I never wore earrings.  It was too much of a hassle to bring my mommy in with me to get a simple piercing, so I waited until I was 18 to get the piercing done.  I went in on my birthday and upon seeing my ID, the guy at the counter wished me \"happy birthday.\"  I know that's not a big deal, but it definitely created a good vibe and little things like that in a skeptical situation can make a big difference.  \n\nThere were people still waiting to get their piercings done, so I had to wait a bit before I was shown the jewelry.  After I picked my earrings out, I had to wait even longer to be escorted into a room.  I'd say overall, the wait time was probably about an hour.  I don't think that's Blue Lotus's fault, though.  It was busy, and people had appointments, and I did not.  \n\nEventually I was taken back into a room by Myke.  He was very kind and thorough in explaining to me what was going to be done and making sure that I knew how clean the whole process was.  He washed his hands and changed his gloves numerous times and even though I'm a bit crazy about germs, I felt completely comfortable.  \n\nI turned out that my hole hadn't completely closed up, and Myke was able to just insert something through my ear the opened the hole back up.  There was a bit of pain, but nothing bad by any means.  I'm very afraid of needles, so I began to get dizzy when the first ear was done.  He kept asking me if I was okay throughout the entire process, and when I told him I was dizzy, he was extremely understanding and finished the other ear with my lying down.  After the piercings were done, he had me check in the mirror and explained to me the steps to take in the weeks to come.\n\nI didn't get a tattoo or a major piercing, but I can testify that the Blue Lotus staff, especially Myke, is professional, kind, and extremely careful about cleanliness and sanitation.  I would recommend Blue Lotus to anyone!\n\nEar piercings at Blue Lotus cost $15, but mine was only $5 because it was just reopening a previous piercing.  My earrings were Neometal with CZ and set me back $60.

Jeremy Wolff was our contact throughout our planning stages and he was always very responsive and accommodating.  My husband and I went back to Vegas about 4 months prior to our wedding to meet with them and get a feel for their energy and they were great and easy to talk to in person.  At our actual reception, our DJ was Tom and he was, by far, one of the most professional, attentive and all-around nicest people we dealt with for our wedding.  \n\nWe are from Toronto, Ontario and brought 103 guests with us to celebrate our wedding and marriage at Caesars Palace.  Of course, our ceremony was one of our main priorities in terms of ensuring that it went smoothly, but our reception (the food and music) were of utmost importance as well because so many friends and family attended.  So there were 2 things that we wanted to ensure we gave our loved guests - a beautiful outdoor ceremony (thanks Caesars Palace!) and a rocking party.  \n\nTom was fantastic from his emceeing duties, to the attention he paid to our song requests, to his regular (and not bothersome) follow-up's with us throughout the night to make sure everything was going well, to being accommodating for the surprise games that our guests had planned for us.  His mixes were also fantastic and he ended the night on a super high note for us.\n\nWe also went with photography and lighting services through them.  The prices for their lighting were incredibly competitive and affordable compared to others.  And the photographer they assigned to us (Jeniffer LaRocca) was fantastic as well.  She was very accommodating, so friendly and very professional as well.  She provided us with about 720 pictures of our reception.\n\nWe also went through them for our Elvis impersonator and we was A+!\n\nOur only regret is that we wished we ended our reception later and we kept Jeniffer for the whole night!", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2015-03-10"}, {"user_id": "-jqjlvvIJNnLYhpb4ovDUQ", "review_id": "C_hSy8TgxUCJvfxZhmMpkA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "82hYL5WPQpvxg8ekDsB83A", "text": "I've been to this chain before, just not this location.

Honestly, I've seen much larger portions at my child's elementary school!  If that wasn't bad enough, the lasagna was made without any cheese--no layers of ricotta between the layers of pasta, and if there had been any cheese on top, it had hardened since it was cooked the first time.  It was camouflaged with a marinara sauce. dumped on top.  Had it not been for the bread, I would have starved!

So instead of dinner at Nota Bene, we signed 10 documents in triplicate at Bloor and Ossington, then wandered, starving, into the first place we saw that looked interesting. \n\nIt's definitely not fair to compare Queen of Sheba to Nota Bene, but in comparing it to other Ethiopian places I've eaten, in Toronto and elsewhere, it's really not in the same ballpark.  \n\nDo you want the good news or the bad news first?  Read bottom to top if you're a good news first kind of person.  \n\nThe decor and cleanliness were really, really sketchy.  My husband and I (who were in a surprisingly good mood given the turn of events) commented that had it not been for fairly significant dining experiences in various developing countries, we would have high-tailed it out of there.  Just inside the front door we were greeted with the stale smell of cigarettes and just damp dirtiness; fortunately as we passed the kitchen and entered the dining room the smell greatly improved.  The carpeted(!) dining room was sorely in need of a shampoo.  The bathrooms were freezing cold and let's just say not spotless.  The paint in the dining room looked half-finished, with roller marks on the ceiling and some unfortunate color choices, and patches just not finished, like the painter quit half way through the job.  One upshot was the lighting, which was mostly from wall sconces pointing upward (not bad when ceiling mounted neon lights would have fit right in with the rest of the decor choices).\n\nThe service.  Oh God the service. She was pleasant but either really ditsy or really high.  My husband asked what the premium beers mentioned on the menu were and she just shrugged and said she didn't know.  In a  nice way, though.  When we told her we don't eat red meat and asked if we could do a platter that was a mix of chicken and veg she seemed sort of confused.  She suggested we do the mixed platter, but minus the beef and lamb, about which I sought to confirm that that might mean more chicken and veg given the absence of the other items.  To which she responded, nicely, no.  Being hungry and in no mood to be difficult, we just ordered the mixed platter of chicken, beef, lamb and vegetables, and I proceeded to eat red meat for the first time in 18 months. \n\nThe food was ok.  The beef was actually a highlight.  It was stewed in a dark sauce with a hint of sweetness.  The chicken was two drum sticks in a spicy sauce and the meat was tender and flavorful.  The lamb was nice as well, though the tender meat was done a disservice by a not very flavorful sauce.  The three vegetable dishes, a split pea, a lentil and a cabbage dish, were disappointingly bland (they made me glad we hadn't gone for the vegetarian platter).  And finally, the side plate of injera was right out of the refrigerator.  That sucked, actually.\n\nThe best thing I can say is that the price was right.  For a huge platter of food for two plus three beers it was $40 plus tip.  That's a pretty good savings versus what we would have spent at Nota Bene...", "stars": 1, "cool": 1, "useful": 2, "date": "2010-01-17"}, {"user_id": "uWeAWWzKpOl6o7V-BdtUGg", "review_id": "Zln8LAdjFXSjmg77ZpOCtw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "CuR4Xxu_aHrYD0IGGRdm5Q", "text": "I had a really good lunch here today.

A couple of days later my co-workers were going to House of Leng for lunch and invited me to go so I did.  \n\nBased on a recommendation, I ordered the Crispy Scallion Chicken with, you guessed it, fried rice.

You have been warned.\n\nHere is my story: I ordered my pizza on a Sunday morning at 1:00 AM. After putting in my order they said that the kitchen was a little backed up with orders and that my pizza would be there within 45 minutes to an hour. Thinking that we had some time to kill before the pizza got there, I decided to set an alarm for 45 minutes and got some shut eye. 45 minutes later my alarm went off, but no pizza had yet arrived. I then waited another 20 minutes to give them some leeway. No pizza as of 2:00 AM. I called and they answered. I asked about my pizza and they clearly told me \"It's just out of the oven and on its way out. It will be there in 10 minutes.\"\n\n30 minutes pass and no pizza. At that time I was understandably upset and decided to call to cancel my order. I called and the line just kept ringing. I began to call again for the next 10 minutes and I never got an answer, not even a machine.\n\nBeing so tired that I was no longer hungry, I decided to go to sleep so I could catch my flight in the daytime. That was at 3:00 AM.\n\nNext thing I know there's a loud banging on my door. I look at my clock at the time is 4:00 AM!!! And alas, my pizza had finally arrived along with the rest of my friends from the club. Funny thing is first thing my friends said was \"The delivery guy just tried to sell us your pizza while in the elevator for $20.\" By now, every single person would be pissed off out of their mind. I talk with the delivery guy and calmly say \"The pizza is over 2 hours late. 3 hours from since I had ordered it. I do not want it, and I do not want to pay for it.\" He gives me a blank stare and all he says is \"Are you serious?\" as if I am not in my right mind to be doing this to him. He goes on to say that it is not his fault, but obviously someone screwed up. I tell him that I am not paying for it and for him to refund me back my money. He leaves, but not without cursing at me.\n\nThree days later a charge of $37 goes through onto my account from Pizza Di Roma for a pizza that was 3 hours late and I didn't even get. I DID NOT SIGN THE RECEIPT! So the only excuse is that they forged my signature, and added a $2 tip. AS I WARNED ABOVE.

Their posted hours are 730a-3p and we snuck in around 240p. We were a little worried we might be rushed, or even turned away (yes, it's happened to us before at another small business which I reviewed on here). Our server (I didn't catch her name) promptly sat us and got us drinks without any rush at all.\nWe ordered our food and with her quiche, there was a small side salad.  Now my better half is deathly allergic to vinegar, so she just put it to the side. When our server came to check on us, she asked if everything was okay with the salad, and we told her about the vinegar allergy, and apologized for not mentioning it prior. She asked if she wanted a different salad, but the quickly realized that all the dressings had vinegar in them. So she offered us not only a side of fries, but truffle fries That was very nice of her to offer.\nNot once throughout the meal, did we get an inkling of them wanting to rush us out. In fact, as we were finishing up, we asked for a \"to-go\" cup for her coffee and the gentleman behind the counter offered us fresh cup for the road. Wow! And he even made her a latte instead!\nSo we paid the check and on the way out, the same gentleman behind the counter asked if he could have a minute of our time. After that, of course. I figured it was for a customer comment card or a survey. He asked if we had tried any of their fresh pastries and we nodded no (I think he noticed my better half drooling on the glass pastry display as we walked in and waited to be seated). He pulled out a brown \"to-go\" box and proceeded to explain what each pastry was as he placed them in the box. About half a dozen pastries later, he closed the box, pushed it across the counter and said, \"I hope you enjoy them!\" He introduced himself as Devin and wished us a great rest of our day. A great meal AND some great desserts?!? Double wow!\nThere are lots of great places to eat in this fantastic city of ours. Some have great dishes that you may or may not remember, but I think you ALWAYS remember that great feeling of when a business makes you feel WANTED and APPRECIATED.

Upon arriving to this shop of course the owner Juan greeted me with promises of completing my Audi TT within a week.  The work consisted of them installing a body kit and a complete paint job.  He told me that the job would be completed within a week and that I had nothing to worry about because they run 24/7.  \n\nSo when the week came, I went up there to view the progress that was made.  For the week they only took off my front bumper.  Since the owner was never there at the shop I always had to relay any message to his admin.  I informed the admin to have him call me in which he never did.  \n\nTwo weeks in, I went back up to the shop to see the progress that was made to my vehicle once again  The owner Juan told me that my car would be completed the following day.  So when I proceeded to come up there I saw that nothing was done to my car, but them taking off my front and rear bumpers, the hood, and the truck cover.  So nothing was completed on my car like he promised.  Also, he was about to paint my black and not the color I requested.  The owner Juan couldn't even call me to verify if he had the right color because allegedly his computer was on the fritz.  I started to notice how unorganized they were as well. So I started to make other arrangements with a different body shop.  \n\nThe owner is full of crap and he will never call you back for anything to give you any status even as he was going to paint my car in a color that was not originally stated.  The only time that I was called (not by the owner) was to verify the color of the diamond grid inserts. I could see the amusement on their faces as I kept coming back from the other side of Las Vegas for which nothing all for nothing (wasted much time and gas).  It makes it even worse when they lie that I should come there in which he knows that the vehicle isn't complete.  \n\nEven though I do feel bad what happened to his team members being in a car accident, he should have informed me of their incident so I could have made other arrangements.  I spent money on car rentals and took days off of work waiting for my small car to be completed.  The work that I saw them doing on other vehicles where were shoddy at best.  When I was back in their shop it like their paint jobs consisted of them using a couple cans of cheap spray paint that was used to tag a wall with gang signs.    \n\nAfter I saw their crappy work first hand, I immediately took my car to another reputable body shop.  But before I left, I cussed out the owner by primarily telling him that his business practice were shady and that he is a liar for telling me that my car was completed not once, but several times. Even as the quote that he gave sounded like a great deal, but don't ever take that into consideration.  Since the owner is never at his own shop, the workers there don't care about your vehicle and they lie just like the owner. From first hand experience this body shop is shady and if you want to be upset, spend extra time and money then this is the place to go.   Even though it sounds like a great deal (don't pay them up front), you will get what you paid for and it will be nothing in return.

I've had them several places, even at Cosmic Ray's in Tomorrowland, and they usually are *terrible*.  This one was good.  Fries were tasty.  The service was nice: they seemed interested in whether we came back, so I'll give them points for that.  Always good :)!\n\nthe Bad: \nThe charge was $9.36 for the veggie burger meal.  My friend got a charburger meal, same sizes of everything: $10.36.  Given this the drink seemed small (and a foam cup!) and the amount of fries seemed small, even though I ended up full enough.  For the same or less money at FiveGuys you feel like you get more fries and a better drink cup, plus free peanuts.

They also seem to expect a tip here, whereas at FiveGuys it is not so.  Now if you are paying $11.00 for burger and fires, then adding a tip, I'll skip the soda pop and go to Red Robin.

My friend doesn't add the sauce.  They also have those little spicy peppers from Italy you can add yourself, I eat 3-4 of these and love it.

It was managed by a different company, and it was a really nice place.  Quiet, working class residents, and families.  When the current mgt company took over, it started to slowly take a turn for the worse.  First thing they did was try to hassle me about my recent lease renewal before the prior company left.  Said I was paying to little.  Sorry, I signed the contract, you have to honor it......I agree with the other reviewers that stated how bad the customer relation skills of the employees in the leasing office are. (With the exception of CJ, he is very pleasant, and easy to talk to.  Unfortunately, he has no managerial power).  Less than a year ago I was on a 4month medical leave due to a kidney transplant.  My benefits were taking long to go through, so I advised the office of my situation, and wanted to work something out.  Sorry, no dice.  Since it took an extra 2 weeks to receive my funds (now I was over 10days late) they filed papers with a lawyer, and I got served.  So the money I just got, had to go to late fees, plus the lawyer fees, which were over $200 alone.  I wasn't allowed to set up a payment plan, pay half, or any other option.  Nice way to treat a long term tenant.  \n\nThey used to be so strict with issues such as picking up after your dog, parking your car properly within the lines. and noise problems.  Sadly all these things have gone.  It's almost like dodging land mines everyday.  Many of us have complained, but their HONEST to GOODNESS answer was, \"Well if we don't know who it is, we can't do anything about it.  Maybe if you took a picture of them, or told us the apt #\".......So I should hide in the bushes with a camera, or stalk the person?  I asked if they could at least put out a letter asking residents to be more mindful and respectful.  They said no.\nNow I see abandoned cars with flat tires, broken headlights, and expired plates.  They used to have the vehicles towed just for having an expired plate.  The grills have been broken (handles, burners, self igniter, etc) for well over 4 years.\n\nSadly, the complex has mirrored the surrounding neighborhood a great deal the past few years.  Even a lot of the residents are just rude and discourteous.  They'll park in your spot or take up both theirs and yours.  Other neighbors have complained of their cars and apartments being broken into. And yet we still have no type of security presence. \n\nIf you're a new tenant, they are all smiles and welcome you in.  But as a current resident, their expression conveys more of a \"What do you want?\" attitude.  You try to ask a question, or ask for help with maybe dealing with problems in the common areas (like broken bbq grills), and you get a 'Yeah we know', or a 'We'll look into it'.  Nothing ever happens.  They DON'T take care about the current and long term residents.  And because of all these issues, many of the good people have left.  \n\nThis for sure is my last lease.  It can't come fast enough.  If I'm able to save up enough money, I just may break it, so I can get out.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 6, "date": "2011-10-01"}, {"user_id": "xkUrA4Zut0IHWGKrW0hbug", "review_id": "zy0c3mccCFEPyXF6POYjMQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "oi3FWENKZ5y_bDCpEb8yOw", "text": "Great environment, but a little on the expensive side.

Not having our beverages in hand we thought it prudent to wait for the beverages (half price at the bar) but hostess said that we would then have to forfeit our table.

Only complaint was that there were a few \"fishy\" pieces in the mix, but not sure if that's the nature of catfish (avoid the darker pieces if so).\n\nThe chicken and waffles were ok, the pieces of chicken were a little too well done and smallish, the waffles were mini waffles - nice presentation.  But after having this dish here - I'm inspired to just make belgian waffles on my waffle maker, add a little cinnamon to the mix and pair it with some Popeyes chicken and Tabasco sauce - and save my stomach for other dishes on their menu.\n\nThe real highlight of our dinner was the smothered steak ... OMG ... so good - we had the gravy on the side so it didn't mask the flavor of the steak.

I was disappointed.  I myself have larger tanks for my Axolotls in my own home :/.  So then I realize none of the turtles have basking areas in their enclosures and are severely overstocked.  The fish and stingrays all had serious injuries, missing/clouded/deformed eyes, shredded fins, and many looked very ill.  The bear habitat was a disappointment as it looked dangerous for the little baby bears in it with a huge drop that could injure them.  The hedgehog exhibit was way too small and had no wheel which is very important as they run a lot! The most sickening was the seal exhibit which had a pool about the size of a hot tub and over 3 seals in it just swimming in loops.  We saw they have a larger enclosure but it's only for shows and they didn't have access to it while I was there :(.  There were animals missing from their enclosures such as this one species of ducks which had both escaped and we found them across the zoo playing in a sewage system.  One monkey had tons of missing patches of fur.

My husband and I had reservations for two hours before we went to see a show that I've wanted to see for years. We had a Groupon that was two courses (burgers with sides and a dessert) with wine. We were seated (one of six tables with two servers, a manager and a bartender...so not exactly busy) and it took 20 minutes for a server to come by and get us water. We ordered the wine and were ready to order, but he said he'd get the wine first. We waited another 20 minutes. He came back over with the wine and took a good five minutes opening it, telling us that the manager was too busy to get the wine and he usually doesn't open the wine. He then was about to leave and I told him we'd like to order. He took our order and the food came out pretty quickly, about 15 minutes later. It was fine. Not as good as some of the other burger places in Vegas like Holsteins, Burgr or LBS. The fries tasted like they came out of a freezer bag. We ate and then sat another 20 minutes waiting for them to clear our table. When we finally ordered dessert, we waited another 20 minutes until I was livid because we were going to be late for our show. An hour and forty minutes for a one course meal?! Our server came out and told us that they didn't have the dessert we ordered, even though we saw it come out for other guests. They charged us for the extra side we ordered and tax and tip, but since we had to leave we never got the dessert that we had paid for. The manager and server were not apologetic and were quite rude. I would never, never go back to this place. And needless to say, we missed the first 15 minutes of a show I've waited years to see. \n\nI typically am very forgiving at restaurants as my husband works in the service industry and I know things can get hectic, but seriously.

Well, three phone calls and 15 hours (no joke) later did they finally act on it. In the meantime they filed creditor claims and tried numerous times to disconnect the account. Each of the three times we spoke to a representative they would tell us it had been resolved. Yet the following week there was no record and money had not been transferred. Now that we have that finally rectified it turns out they did not transfer all the funds and are now claiming we owe them more money despite our bank record stating it was paid. They can't find the funds and have advised it will take another two weeks to do a search--in the meantime we need to pay the full amount or they will mark our account in arrears again!  Get this though, in the same day they supposedly rectified some of the money transfer between accounts, they issued a rebate check and transferred the money. And then again, the had the gall to blame us for their mistake.\n\nNow about that $50 deal, we were told that despite printing off records of our conversation complete with the representatives name and ID # that they will not honor that amount there is nothing they can do and we should have known that was not a realistic quote. That sounds like Bait and Switch to me!\n\nNever once have they apologize--in fact every time I've spoken to them they have told me its my fault--I even had one representative tell me I should be angry with myself!\n\nLastly, I would advise when reading their contract they do have a small stipulation that says even if they have a promotional offer with a timeframe attached to it, they can bump up the price at any time and payment made means you tacitly approve of the increase--they don't actually have to notify you.\n\nWell Century Link you've lost one customer and made me so pissed I will post bad reviews wherever I can and I've never done that before.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 10, "date": "2013-09-27"}, {"user_id": "p330Vfwtd0Dg8nQHAFP_8w", "review_id": "B1zwIuXchx4ndbahnm2ltw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "eRGTss9r2Et8s_1UiPBKOg", "text": "Gave Sconnie Bar another chance.

When we ordered a beer, a coke, and a glass of water, he snarkily responded, \"Oh yeah, part-tay!\" We were there with a person who had a food allergy and we asked him for a suggestion of what he could order, and the watier responded in a very dismissive manner. \"Just tell me what you want to eat,\" he said. When we mentioned that two of us were planning to share a bucket of chicken, he suggested we go for the large version. Now neither my friend nor I are Jabba the Hutt, so there was no way in hell two people could finish so much chicken. He then forgot to place our order and left without telling us he was switching servers. We had to order again after 30 minutes and when the food did come, it was giant baseballs of chicken and they were thrown unceremoniously on the table on a brown paper mat. There were two measly halves of a biscuit thrown in with the chicken, and when we bit into one of them, we noticed that it had the consistency of chewing gum and realized that it was still raw. We thought that they were apologizing by giving us a discount on the chicken (charging us for the small bucket rather than the large), but after we paid, our waitress realized that she had mixed up our order with someone else's. We were then forced to pay for this disgusting bucket of chicken.

Well he tightened them so tight that they lost the curve and they are completely flat.  Yes I don't have any roll at the bottom of my eyes making them look unnatural.  I traveled though out the US seeking ocular surgeons (many of them lecturing all around the world writing books etc) all but 3 turned me away saying they have never seen eyes like mine before and couldn't repair what is going on. I went back to johns but he didn't offer any solution but to end our doctor patient relationship.  Not only are my lower lids almost non existing he also injected fat by fat graphing and now I am dealing with fat lumps that can not be removed, he gave me only one 5fu injection after months of my complaints and 6 weeks later he said he couldn't see it.  Well trust me it's still there along with many other lumps.  I agreed to pay him more money to have my cheeks injected with filler but i guess he must have seen my review on realself.com that's when I was notified that he and I are on different planes, and he finds it best if I seek another doctor.

I went to the Eastern location about a month or so ago because I had come down with a cold that very literally became bronchitis overnight.  How do I know you ask?  Well because I'm an adult who has had it about 6 times before.  I know the symptoms, I know the treatment, I know what I need to get back to healthy.  I go thinking that as a quick care it would be, oh, quick-ish.  Ha!  About 10 people who arrived after me were seen before me; I ask the front desk person and she says \"well, we have x-rays back here too\".  Uh, huh.  Fine, after about an hour I get seen by a nurse (I think, she never introduced herself and frankly her broken English wasn't very clear) who takes my vital signs and asks me the reason for my visit.  I tell her.  She asks if I had been having contractions (I was about 30 weeks pregnant) I say yes but that they were braxton hicks and was not of concern.  She sends me back out to lobby to wait for another hour and a half.  Sigh.  Finally I get called back to see the doctor!  Yay!  I sit down and wait for him to come in.  He does and asks why I'm there.  I tell him because I have bronchitis and need to get a breathing treatment and an albuteral inhaler prescription (again, I've been at this rodeo a few times).  He says well if you do have bronchitis I won't give you antibiotics.  I say that's fine because I didn't ask for any.  I know that it's viral not bacterial and that antibiotics are seldom called for (unless you have an uncommon case of bacterial which is unlikely).  So he says well, why don't you let me decide what you have.  Fine, no problem, I wouldn't expect you to just take my word for it.  So as he goes to listen to my chest he says, well, it says here that you're having contractions.  I say, well yes but they're braxton hicks; I'm here because I can't breathe.  So he says well a woman who's 30 weeks pregnant and having contractions should go to the hospital.  At this point, his condescension was so ridiculous I couldn't hold my tongue any longer so I snap back, gee, I thought this was a medical facility; I didn't realize this was no better than a jungle hut in the middle of the Sudan.  So he says, Whatever, I don't like you attitude, I'm just going to exam you BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU ANYMORE.  Excuse me?  Someone failed bedside manner 101 I see.  I demanded he leave as I was not about to let that jerk exam me for anything.  I ended up just walking out and demanding his name: \"Dr.\" Mathison.  I ended up going to the ER where they...bum bum bum...gave me a steroid injection (because at that point I was barely breathing), a breathing treatment, a prescription for albuteral, and a diagnosis of bronchitis!  They also noted that he was unprofessional, wrong, and ended up sending a pregnant woman to the ER to be exposed to needless germs for no reason as he could have done all of those things at the urgent care facility.

After posting this none of you will think I have a half wit about me.  Perhaps your assessment of me will be accurate BUT I dare to challenge you to look beyond the surface for a deeper appreciation of the GM.  Yes the Galleria Mall is unappealing to the eye.  Yes there are some odd trinket stores and kiosks here and I have no beef with the description of some of the shady characters hanging around this quiet unpretentious mall.\n\nI grew up in Kingston and the more I think about it the more this mall reminds me of the Frontenac Mall in my hometown 30 years ago.  It had a Zellers in the same end of it's mall; it's decor was similar to the Galleria and you felt the same odd / sad feeling as I notice here.\n\nWhen we first moved into the hood 4 years ago our Realtor said the Galleria was supposed to be knocked down.  I remember thinking it couldn't happen soon enough.  Just looking at that place made me want to take a shower.  Well, time and my situation has allowed me to go beyond what I may see as unfortunate design and lack of care to being able to hold this mall in great appreciation.  \n\nHere is my case FOR the Galleria... \n\nIt has a Zellers, YAY Zellers!  I love saving on kid clothes and finding all sorts of things I forgot I needed like soap and underwear and sewing supplies.  \n\nI can go to Price Chopper, YAY Price Chopper!  I used to think PC was so skid.  With a tight budget now-a-days I forced myself to shop there (sometimes).  You want to know what the difference is?  Less brands to choose from.  Big deal, I can save $20 - $40 per shop, I can get down with that!  \n\nA pharmacy - like the time my son was 2 years old, I was very pregers and had to walk to a pharmacy that would likely have the electrolyte for kids so he could gain strength after puking all nite - GM's Pharmaplus had it!  We didn't have a car then so I had to walk in the blowing cold snow.  It was a life saver.  \n\nDid I mention the post office?  Did you know as big and popular as the Duff is there is no post office!?  \n\nAnd where else can I go in my neighborhood for a TD Bank?  No where else I tell you.  \n\nWhen the Dufferin Mall's S&H Health Food store was often out of the crucial herbs I needed to produce milk for my daughter's first year of life, GM's supplement store ALWAYS had it.  Need I go on?  Oh yeah and the liquor store and pet store are there too.  \n\nMy only concern with the GM is feeling a little out of place and more likely to get unwanted attention by the crowd that generally hangs around this place.  Nothing bad just stares at my red boots and glances cast from guys hanging around in the evening when I am walking alone with my Zellers scores to the car in the parking lot.\n\nIn conclusion if you fancy yourself a deeper person than someone who needs surface pleasures to complete their existence I say give this place another chance.  I think of it as a hidden gem and sometimes even a lifesaver.", "stars": 4, "cool": 10, "useful": 16, "date": "2010-10-13"}, {"user_id": "altw5Ky3eroLAjLSZCEVvg", "review_id": "k1bRLZJpqw4TvOPpjZT-Ew", "funny": 0, "business_id": "FSnqO-YWUdRb0Xc95nXbvw", "text": "Great service, cute diner style atmosphere, and good broth.

I was surprised to see a Korean restaurant pop up in place of Los Mariachis.  I had a great experience here - cool ambiance, a sizeable but not overwhelming menu, large portions, and excellent service.\n\nAmbiance - The place has a dark interior with comfortable enough seating.  I enjoyed not having generic fluorescent lighting, and the fish tank added a lot.  Booths were available on the side walls, and there was a K-drama playing on the TV.\n\nMenu - One interesting thing about the menu is that after the Korean name for the dish, the explanation was in English, which I've found to be a rarity.  Unfortunately, there's no phonetic romanization of the Korean name, so you'll have to figure out the dishes from the descriptions.  There's also soju available.\n\nService - My servers were very attentive, constantly refilling water, giving us more rice, and helping to explain some things from the menu and which dishes were which.  They seemed like they could make recommendations pretty effectively, if you're not familiar with Korean food.\n\nFood - Again, the portions were pretty huge!  We ordered the jjamppong/champong (spicy seafood noodle soup) and the ojingo bokkum (spicy stir fried squid), and we had a hard time finishing the soup and finished half of the squid.  The noodles were good and very spicy - not overcooked, though I was hoping for more noodles - and the dish came with a whole prawn, mussels, and squid.  While I would have liked a larger quantity of seafood, I'd take quality over quantity.  The squid was hot and tasty, and had a large amount of scallions and onions.  I was especially happy that we had banchan (side dishes), about 6, and a steamed egg.\n\nPrice - Our dishes were pretty reasonable, about $9 each, but the price range varied a bit.  Obviously, the barbecue dishes are more expensive, but I was disappointed that the pancake appetizers were a bit pricier than I would have liked.  Still, we got a lot of seafood for our $9, and the banchan always make it worthwhile.", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 2, "date": "2008-06-09"}, {"user_id": "N9rarwgiEqAAZ6FYieG4sg", "review_id": "zKtXJkmjlTxUjKpVTL5o8g", "funny": 0, "business_id": "_vHI2zsJp7b02MFJUWJgbw", "text": "Cute little bakery shop with a variety of pastries snd baked goods.

Mine seemed to have been stuck in the tray somehow, and I ended up leaving a heap of the fillings behind before I finally got it into my plate, but anyway, it was fine... I'm not big on certain grilled vegetables (zucchini, squash, chunks of corn), and wished that it had been a simple traditional taco with beans instead of meat, but still... it was light and the seasonings were good.

During our store visit and checkout we were NEVER told we couldn't return these shoes if they didn't fit nor these had a release date that has came and passed. I even looked around the store and saw no signage stating that. They only wanted to offer store credit which doesn't work since we are here on vacation. I looked on the receipt and it said 15 days on raffle items, but nothing on release date. \n\nLuckily after waiting for them to look at the shoes did they finally process the return. Before though they had me write down my name and number on a sheet of paper which was very intrusive of my privacy for them to have on file.\n\nThey did the right thing of allowing the return, but I urge other patrons to avoid this store as the process of informing customers on return policies is lackluster.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2016-02-13"}, {"user_id": "UGA2XG3fpWIW19Jl6y_s-Q", "review_id": "BzkjUGghhfPTLM5Sl_N5qA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ", "text": "My first visit to Indulge left me less than a raving fan, and I tried to capture the reasons in my previous review.

This is true with Spring Mountain Road, as there's Sora Ramen and Monta just up the street.  Then, Hiromaru Fusion ramen opens a few months ago.  It's important that when you are going to Hiromaru, that you understand that it is a \"fusion\" restaurant, not a typical Japanese ramen restaurant.\n\nThe location is very good, centrally located on the end-cap in the center.  One feature that I did not personally like was the \"hyper-lighting\" that was installed with the contemporary design.  You almost need sunglasses to enter, especially when you are entering in the evening.  But, the design elements are excellent, with colors of vanilla and Asian red.  There definitely was no short cuts taken with Hiromaru,  Unlike the disappointing design with Monta, you will be pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail at Hiromaru. \n\nThe food and service were fine, especially for a restaurant that is so young in terms of age.  The ramen was good, as well as the service.  Their price points were excellent.  The important thing to always remember with any restaurant is this question:  Would you return for the food?  Our answer would be yes, especially since you have pretty good features already, which include good food, service and atmosphere.\n\nThe restaurant manager was nice enough to come by our table.  I explained to him the lighting issue and contemporary ottoman style seating.  The manager listened intently and took mental notes.  For the lighting issue, he explained that they were going to switch to the Japanese style lighting, which incorporates rice paper shades.  The ottoman style seating is a bit difficult to move, especially for younger people or women wearing dresses.  There are no back rests to these chairs and you are left struggling with how to move them.  The manager quickly noted that they were looking into \"sliders\", which would be placed under each leg that would make sliding the chairs much easier.\n\nUltimately, Hiromaru ramen will be successful.  They have an excellent opportunity to be a player in the ramen market in Las Vegas.  The important thing is that they are willing to listen to their diners, which can't be said about too many Japanese restaurants!  Hopefully, they'll have the lighting and seating issue resolved for our next visit.  In the meantime, keep in mind when you first enter that this will not be typical of most ramen houses, and that you'll be in a very contemporary one as well.

We called ahead of time to get some general info, mostly because we weren't sure if we wanted to-go or dine in.  Over the phone the lady was extremely courteous and helpful.  The meal is $7.30 all you can eat (we only had a single plate each with a moderate portion).  The to-go price is 35 cents per ounce.\nThe atmosphere is what you would expect from a typical strip mall restaurant.  Not a whole lot of ambiance, but it was very clean.  I double-checked the maricopa county health site, and they get predominantly Gold ratings.\nThe staff was extremely helpful.  The hostess followed us to the line explaining how Mongolian BBQ works.  We were already familiar with the process, but she made sure we were comfortable with everything anyway.\nI think what I liked best about Stir Fry Paradise were the sauces/seasonings.  The meats and veggies are pretty much consistent with most Mongolian BBQ places.  The only real difference is that I thought the sauces were more flavorful.  The other thing I really liked was the shape of the plate.  The plate is large with a handle.  It was easy to transport and dispersed the heat more quickly than the usual bowls.\nWe each only had the one serving, and neither one of us finished the plate.  There were a couple of beefy-sized families that were just tearing up both sides of the grill. It's fun to people watch at all you can eat places. They were already into seconds before we finished our plate, and there were no signs of them slowing down!  In addition to the Mongolian Grill, there is a serving area with rice, chicken wings, bbq beef, and orange chicken (might have been sesame chicken).  Not sure because the Mongolian BBQ was already more food than I could hope to eat.  They also had jello and sugared donuts on the line - didn't have those either, but the donuts sure looked good.\nI give Stir Fry Paradise 5 Stars since the staff was so nice, the food great, and it's a heck of a lot closer than YC's in Scottsdale!

Our application was accepted, although it took almost a week to get an answer back, we also have no idea the name of the owner or where he is located.\nWe loved the property, and decided to give it a shot and move in. We gave them our deposit (which included a $250 cleaning deposit, and they stated that they were going to bring in a cleaning service to do some basic carpet cleaning and wipe down of walls, toilets, etc.)\nCome moving day once we got really close to the walls and got up close and personal with the house we discovered that the walls were filthy, even the ceilings seemed to have some sort of browish yellow splatter on them, even in the bathrooms! The kitchen was the worst. The vent above the stove had old caked on yellow grease which took forever to get off and the tops of the vaulted ceilings in the kitchen (which are almost impossible to reach, just by the way they were designed) had red spaghetti like sauce splatter on them. The walls were dirty and looked like they hadnt been cleaned in a long time, the showers had black mold in them and they had obviously not been cleaned. The only thing that had appeared to be cleaned were the toilets.\nThe first night that were supposed to be moving our stuff in was spent in hours of scrubbing walls and cabinets, baseboards, and painting mismatched half assed paint jobs that were very visible and looked horrible. I dont even know why someone would bother in painting a patch on a wall that does not match at all.\nWhen we ran our vacuum cleaner throughout the house for the first time and our entire canister in the vacuum was filled with fur and dirt, like it hadnt been vaccumed in a long time, and my husband also cleaned the carpets and the water that was being sucked up in the machine was pitch black. It was very obvious that the place had not been cleaned. Most of our money so far has been put into cleaning and painting pure neglect and stupidity. We take pride in our home and dont settle for our home looking dirty with mismatching paint. We contacted Shannon Day so they could send a repairman out to fix the oven (the oven would not ignite and cook food) and that took 2 weeks, the only time that they responded right away was for a plumbing issue. We have only been in the home for a few months and over the last month a few drawers in the kitchen broke because the design of the home builders was to STAPLE the drawer tracks in. My husband had to fix that by hand and secure it to ensure it wouldnt break on us again, but whos to say that others wont break and thats something that Shannon Day isnt going to have someone come and fix. Overall the home is older, but if it was cared for properly by previous tenants then we would not be having these issues, which is frustrating that things are slowly failing on us. Overall, so far, i'm not very happy with Shannon Day.\nOne Good thing out of this is that we have really nice neighbors next to and across from us.\n\nI'm nervous to see how we will be treated come the day that we move out.\nOnly time will tell, but I wont be surprised if it all goes sour.\n\nWhen it comes to doing business with this company....you have been warned.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 7, "date": "2013-10-28"}, {"user_id": "c3AJ3z00cZPFL2uGKnDYog", "review_id": "nwnBSooY-qk5ut7SvmAVBw", "funny": 1, "business_id": "RxT1UYIGeV2UxFFOOrkmOw", "text": "We took our two Shelties to Mark for training.

Around 530PM on a Tuesday evening, the place was about half-full and started to get busier as the everning progressed.

All were good, strong, and tasty.  Pretty sure you can't go wrong with a 'tini with flavors you like.  These martinis are $12-14 a piece, but since it was happy hour (4-8PM), they were half off.  So at $7 a martini, still a bit spendy, but a nice treat.  And, yes, they do give you the mini shaker to ensure you get your entire beverage- just be sure to not let them take it before you've ensured it's empty.\n\nThe food-  with food half-off as well, we ordered the BBQ Chicken flatbread (tasty, but mostly bread- more cheese, chicken, sauce please), Spinach-Artichoke dip with Pita chips (pretty tasty), and the Bruschetta (basically chopped tomatos on toasted bread- nothing special).  All of these were regularly around $12 a piece, I believe ($6-ish with happy hour).\n\nThe service-  good, not great.  Our waitress actually came around a few times, but only when it seemed like she KNEW we wanted to order something.  Annoyingly, the other people working there would come by every 5 minutes to take our plates, drinks, etc., even when we obviously weren't finished.

Waitress was rude and disrespectful to customers. McDonalds provided better service (not meant as a knock on McDonalds)\n\n\nAt the beginning, service was decent (nothing out of the ordinary. Sit down, order drinks, etc.). However, when the drinks began to arrive, it became evident that the waitress was inept in regards to her occupation. She was unable to recognize the drink that was being delivered and had to return to check (normally, this would be okay. I personally understand that some people mess up... But with her attitude as detailed below... That was not acceptable. If you want to act as if you know more than other people. Don't just say it... Prove it).\n\nThings were fine until the bill arrived (It should be noted that we didn't ask for the bill... Nor was our allotted time up). As we noticed that the bill was combined, we asked if it was possible to split the bill (available in most service industry establishments, especially restaurants such as this one). Upon inquiry into this relatively minor issue, we were informed that it was \"not possible for them to split the bill\".\n\nAlthough most establishments are expected to be able to provide this service, it is understandable that this may not always be possible... So we did not pursue the issue. Following this incident was what led to this review.\n\nUpon payment of the bill (along with the tips that we believed was ample relative to the level of service provided), we were informed that the amount provided was not sufficient. At this time, we were brought to the attention of a \" mandatory 10? tip\" which was not mentioned anywhere around the store or menu (this is not the primary issue). The issue was the manner in which this was brought to our attention.\n\nThe following is a paraphrase of the waitresses' statement\n\"... This is not enough. It's 10% tips. I assumed you knew this\"\n\nDespite the confusion that took place, it was the attitude in which the statement was made that attracted our attention. Her attitude can be described simply as \"rude and \" snarky\".\n\n\nIn Canada, although it is socially accepted that tips should be provided... It should reflect the level of service provided. The service provided was not sufficient to the level where one would expect a 10% tip. The cashier at McDonalds provided more quality service than the waitress mentioned (to the extent that I considered giving him a larger tip for our simple exchange than the one provided to the waitress)\n\nIn conclusion, the service provided at this location was deplorable (I am not in a position to speak about other stores). The lack of information provided to a consumer was unbelievable. However, most importantly was the attitude and sense of entitlement that was displayed by the waitress. \n\nAs stated in an infamous saying, \"you reap what you sow\". The tips provided should be a reflection of the service provided... Not what the waiter feels she is entitled to. If you are considering food and drinks (with decent/good service)... Go to the McDonalds at the nearby intersection.\n\nP.s. My review states one star...

I should point out here that the cheese had a slight tanginess I didn't like (same as with Stuffed Rolls);  mind you I am very eclectic (and even weird) when it comes to cheese (for example I hate cheddar, unlike 95% of people) so unless you've tried other versions of the Cheesy Bites you probably won't notice the difference. \n\nOtherwise the crust and sauce were just perfect. The crust was chewy and soft without greasiness or sogginess and combined with the sauce it had a very pleasant sweet taste.\n\nThe price for the large Cheesy Bites was about $12 or $15 if you choose a specialty pizza (like the Lovers pizza) and while it may not be the cheapest pizza in town, especially for a pizza chain, is good value for something different. If you just want great cheap pizza try Jesse's Pizza or Pizza My Dear for $5.\n\nThe pizza was baked adequately, maybe it would be better with a minute less or so but the baking at Pizza Hut is usually automated.\n\nThe place wasn't crowded on a Friday night and service was fast and very warm and firendly, such a rarity these days.\n\nOverall I'd give this version of the Cheesy Bites 8.5/10 and this store 4.5/5.", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "useful": 2, "date": "2010-12-04"}, {"user_id": "EfOhaQ-J5s9t2EmH0uBELw", "review_id": "M79VAhvABi4HZLSS03k0Fw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w", "text": "I am completely obsessed with this place! Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed!!!!  \n\nA friend suggested this place to meet and study one night during finals week and I was impressed upon arrival.  Where else in Vegas can you find a cute little indie cafe?  There are couches, tables, and even a loft for people to do their thing at.  It smelled so good in there too!  Just a whiff of it would probably wake you up.   \n\nI wasn't much of a coffee fan before.  I thought it just tasted like mud (or what I would imagine mud to taste like), but then I tried it here.  I got the gingerbread man latte.  It wasn't too sweet and I liked that you could taste the coffee rather than just the gingerbread flavor.  I admit that coffee still isn't my favorite, but if I had to have it anywhere, Sambalatte is where I'll go.  Just a heads up, their espresso shots are strong!! My brother asked for an extra shot in his mocha (I guess that's how he orders at the other places), and the barista warned him that their shots are the equivalent of 3 of the chain coffee houses.  Personally, I like their teas.  They use actual tea leaves and not the diluted tea bags that  everywhere else uses.  My goal is to try every single one they have.  I also like that they have sandwiches, salads, cheese platters, and pastries.  Light lunch anyone??  \n\nThe best thing about this place: presentation!!  Two words...FOAM ART!!  It's a simply touch but it can make all the difference.  Let's just call it luxury in a cup!  Their teas are served in a glass tea press.  Again, it's not much, but it's the little things that matter!  \n\nAfter raving on and on about this place, it goes without saying that I think this is a must try.

In any case, their newly fixed donut machines are producing a distinct taste and it has definitely improved the quality of their donuts.  There's always room for improvement, hence the 3 stars (instead of 2).  If they can work with prices, or offer a stamp card program then I may boast their ratings. These are supposed to be \"gourmet donuts\", i.e., not your typical cheaply made grocery store donuts, so expect to pay premium prices.", "stars": 3, "cool": 1, "useful": 3, "date": "2015-06-17"}, {"user_id": "K_LbAf0mSdPGAU2yrVpDbA", "review_id": "71MxpQ4WLwZzMcG_Qjmpbw", "funny": 1, "business_id": "l4aOxIebSHm503N0uWeyPw", "text": "The girls in the leasing office have HORRRRRRIBLE attitudes..

The decor was pleasant, but that was the extent of the good comments. The waitress for our section had 3 to 5 tables. Everyone experienced the same thing. Our waitress was so poorly trained she couldn't enter an order in the computer. The service was horrible. Our silverware was filthy and had to ask twice for replacements. We ordered bruscitta as and appetizer. The cost was $8.00 which seemed fair until it finally arrived. It was very small 1/8\" slices of toasted bread served with a small bowl of what only could be described as salsa. Our entrees were cheese ravioli and a Vodka Penne. The portions were generous, but that would assume you would want to eat it. The Penne had proschucta that was dry like jerky. There were spaghetti noodles mixed in with the Penne and the taste was not good. Bar service was really slow and everyone in our combined sections felt better going to the bar ourselves.

Went in, couldn't get sat until 7:40 because the server was too busy to handle another table. Well I can tell you right now there were only 8 tables sat in the entire restaurant, I walked around and looked. We ordered drinks right away. 3 waters, a kids root beer, and a blackberrry mojito. At 8:05pm, we still had not got our drinks. 25 mins after we ordered them. So I went and told the host. 5 minutes later, our server comes back by  and says \"I'll bring your drinks out in a minute, the bar is just really busy.\" And I literally looked at him and went \"for my freaking water?\" And he was like \"I want to wait for everyone to get their drinks at the same time\" No! Bring me my water. It's been 30 minutes for some f-ing water! So 30 minutes for water and 40 minutes for a mojito? Seriously? What kind of establishment are you guys running. Finally takes our order. He walked away while we were trying to tell him to add an extra portion for the kid that was with us so we told the manager. We also told the manager multiple times we were not happy with the server or experience and the manager just shrugs us off basically. Server comes out with cheese. Alpine, and the Wisconsin cheddar. Well, that's what we ordered at least. What he brought out was the Wisconsin trio, which has bleu cheese in it, which I'm deathly allergic to. Had he not said it was the trio, I wouldnt have known until after I took a bite, and then I'm being rushed to the hospital because you like to hire incompetent staff. He fixed it. Cool. Water refills get low, very low. He's nowhere to be found. Our cheese has been long done and it's sitting on the table burning and stinking. Probably about 30 minutes we sat there with no water and burning cheese. Manager actually walked past and I flagged him down for more water and told him again we were unhappy. Shrugs us off. Server comes over to remove cheese. We order chocolate. Chocolate comes out. We eat it. Again, no water refills for a long time. Burning chocolate on the table. Drops off check. Leaves burning chocolate. We pay, we leave. Burning chocolate is still on table. Very rude server. All night he had an attitude, slamming things on the table, etc. I'm a server myself. I had just got off from my serving job. If my manager had heard I let a table go 30 minutes without water, I would've been fired on the spot probably. If a table had complained to the manager that they were unhappy, the manager would not have just shrugged them off. Worst dining experience ever. Will not come back. Not worth the money. $20 for our bowl of cheese. $20 for a bowl of chocolate. These bowls are literally the spice of a small dogs dish. I've bought cheese from Walmart in a jar for like $5 and it's a larger portion than what I got here. Please do not come here. 2 and a half hours I was there for some cheese and chocolate.

Based on reviews we had high expectations. The restaurant has a casual, authentic ambiance with lots of people celebrating the holiday season. My husband and nephew had Sukiyaki with a tray of fresh ingredients which they cooked as they ate. Their dinner was ready in about 10 minutes. My daughter had Chirashi  which arrived shortly after from the sushi bar. After more than an hour passed, I asked the waitress about my Salmon Teriyaki, a simple item to prepare. She rushed into the kitchen and informed me it was coming but there were many orders ahead. After 15 minutes more, another waitress told me the Thursday evening Chef was \"slow\" and suggested I order from the sushi bar. My choices had to exclude items that involved the Chef in any way (e.g., soft shell crab for Spider Roll). I chose Makisushi and California Roll. After another 10 minutes, the waitress returned looking stressed since the Chef had made my dinner and would be upset if I cancelled. So, I accepted the dinner. The plate had two slices of Pacific salmon which were overcooked and served with a dollop of uninspired potato salad. The Japanese love mayonnaise but this was not delicious potato salad. To compensate for the Chef's fiasco in the kitchen the waitress brought us a special dessert - oranges! My daughter commented that this was the standard fruit served at the end of Ematei meals. I cannot recommend Ematei, unless you are prepared to wait endlessly and do not mind accommodating an unhappy Chef, frightened waitresses and unconcerned management!
