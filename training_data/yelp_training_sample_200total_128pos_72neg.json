They do one thing and do it well: Halal Pakistani cuisine. The space is fairly plain, the decor is mostly barebones, and they've been 'under renovations' for the last few years. Despite that, this place seems to run seamlessly and churns some serious Indian food. Outdoors they have a large patio where the huge indoor space can spill over to in the warmer months once the restaurant gets busy, which it inevitably does. If the seating is full and there's a line at the door, no worries, this place has a great takeout service, which I usually get. Just call ahead, and it's usually piping hot and set for pickup in about 20 minutes.\n\nFlaky with hint of spice and smokiness, Lahore's samosas are better than your average samosas on the Gerrard. But my usual order includes the Vegetable Biryani. It's a huge portion of perfectly cooked Basmati rice, tomaotes, peppers, cauliflower, chickpeas, potatoes, and a mild blend of tumeric, cumin, and chili powder. I also love their Paneer cheese. The squeaky Indian cheese is an unaged curd cheese that is denser than tofu, but seems to absorb flavours just the same.  Lahore serves their Paneer Tikka Masala, and in my opinion, it's the city's best. Lightly seared and tandoor, it's served in a smoky, slightly spicy sauce; it's made the way it should be. And of course, be sure to order a side of their naan bread. Not only is it lightly oiled, seasoned, and softly charred, but it's also perfect for making sure you soak up all of the sauce.\n\nNext time you're looking for some Indian food, forget all those 'all you can eat' buffets and head to Lahore Tikka House on Gerrard East. It sets the bar pretty high for good Indian food in Toronto.", "cool": 2, "date": "2010-11-27", "funny": 0, "review_id": "Pswa777brp60Z7SYvptBeQ", "business_id": "RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w", "stars": 4, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "useful": 3}, {"text": "Anyone remember when Future Bakery was big business? It had multiple locations around Toronto, and it was focused heavily on the food and culture of its Ukrainian ownership. While the Annex location is still kicking strong and remains a popular beacon for starving U of T students, the others, except for the tiny St. Lawrence Market outlet and a baking factory in the city's Westend, have all but disappeared. All that remains is a lone, ceramic Ukrainian Easter egg sitting high up on a shelf in the Annex location. But time moves on I suppose, and there's a reason that despite the others all going under, the Annex location is still packed at almost all hours of the day.\n\nFuture is cheap. Straight up, that's probably one of the predominant reasons they're so busy, but it's not as if you're getting some reheated crappy food for your money. They make some pretty good stuff. (Right off the bat, I'd like to point out that there is a food outlet right in the back of this place, and I think they sublease it to sell food in there, but I am including it in this review, despite that they might be two different places.) Most notably, you can grab a pretty good breakfast there, especially on a Sunday morning. Sundays in the Annex are deadsville; everything is closed until the early-afternoon, so if you live in the area or you happen to find yourself there because you thought everything would be open, this is a great place to grab a pleasant morning breakfast or a greasy hangover cure.\n\nFuture has some seriously amazing cakes, and if that's your thing, then you should know that Future is probably one of the best values for cake in the city. Besides having a killer selection of top quality cakes, they all sell for about 5 bucks a cut. There are a whole ton of different kinds too, ranging from fruit pies and caramel-based cakes to cheesecakes and heavy-chocolate tortes. Although I don't find their coffee particularly spectacular, they do have it available, and it's still a pretty natural choice to go with the cake, despite being nothing-more-than-average.\n\nOnce the warmer months hit, Future place has got a pretty spectacular patio too.  Busy, big, and perfect for people watching, it's easily the 2nd best patio spot in the Annex. It covers the whole side of Future's corner building, and it's an ideal place for cold pints.\n\nFuture pretty much accommodates everyone. Early morning breakfast, late night after the bar, mid-week meeting spot, in-between-classes study hole; no matter what you're using it for, chances are that Future will be able to offer you something. So despite the fact that the Ukrainian aspect is no longer really existing here--or at least not being a visible existence--it hasn't slowed this place down at all. Most likely, people haven't even noticed the lack of Ukrainianess. And while purely for nostalgic reasons, I find that a bit on the disappointing side, as long as every time I go in there I can be reminded of Future's past by that lone Uki Easter egg, I'll make due, and I'll being eating cake.", "cool": 1, "date": "2011-02-16", "funny": 0, "review_id": "ihW0mpuMrkkmeN3TeZ4rog", "business_id": "kw8Lh8bJAtquHkT9CB4zGg", "stars": 4, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "useful": 2}, {"text": "Expensive ($90 CDN per head), but really well executed french food.

I wanted to have my dog have comprehensive dental care completed under her care after my regular vet provided me with a full work up and referral for dental work. When I contacted Martin Vet to set up the procedure and provided them with his medical records no one responded to set up an appointment for over a week. After calling back and speaking with multiple staff, I finally heard back from Dr. Conway herself at 7 pm on New Year's Eve.\n\nShe called me on the verge of hysterics insisting that despite the referral from my general vet from a dental visit completed a week ago, and the urgent needs of my dog she needed to first examine the dog and charge for a consultation before scheduling an actual appointment. When I asked if any dental diagnostics could be completed at the consultation, she stated my dog would need to be sedated for that. So, I would have to wait another two weeks to treat my dogs dental needs.\n\nSince my dog recently just had a wellness exam, and the medical records were provided to the office, I asked if the consultation fee could be waived once I paid for the dental procedures and sedation. To my knowledge all medical professionals are expected to examine a patient prior to sedating them when asked regarding this issue, Dr. Conway angrily stated \"No, the day of the procedure we just check their temperature.\" This was very concerning to me and I would not seek care from an establishment that sedates dogs without doing a thorough work up the day of the procedure. \n\nAs a dentist for humans, I can tell you that without radiographs a dental diagnosis/consultation cannot be given, so billing for a dental consult without radiographs and then billing again another separate fee for a dental exam under sedation, is unethical. No dental diagnosis can be obtained without radiographs. As well, it goes without saying that if anyone sedates your pet - a thorough exam should be conducted by the anesthesiologist performing the sedation, all medical records reviewed the day of the procedure rendering the consult performed by Dr. Conway unnecessary and inhumane as it delays the ability for a pet to be treated in a timely and compassionate manner.

I feel like kids can progress and the coaches are aware of when the kids are ready to do so. My girls have moved up 4 levels since we started.  When they are ready to move up, they do, they don't have to even wait for the next session.  Since we do recreational gymmastics, I feel it has been an excellent balance of conditioning , skills, and fun that keeps my girls looking forward to going to gymnastics for over 2 years now!  We had their birthday party there and it was great.  You can choose to go 1x, 2x or 3x a week to help fit your goals for your athlete.

I went there for severe back pain. My first visit I was given medication, X-ray was done and had to get a MRI done. Three days after my first visit I went back in because the medication wasn't working.. When I was asked what was wrong I would begin to explain and would be interrupted every time. I was not given the chance to finish. The doctor gave me stronger meds and sent me on my way. After I went for my MRI I went back into get my results. The doctor explained to me that in the MRI there was nothing really serious and that I should be alright. When I was asked if I was ready to go back to work I informed the doctor that I was still feeling pain. This is when I felt the Jekyll and Hyde situation happened. He went from happy to pissed and 1.5 seconds. He began to yell at me telling me I didn't want to go back to work and he refused to fill out any FMLA papers that I needed to hand into work. He filled out a form for me to get blood work done and told me that my job was in jeopardy and walked out of the room. Oh I should add he also got in my face while talking with a loud voice. I really didn't want to go back there but I was unsure if another doctor would release me for work if they didn't treat me. I went back to get my blood results and to see if he was willing to release me for work. My blood work came back and it showed that I had inflammation I don't know about you but I pretty much think that indicates I'm in pain. The doctor did a 360 and was once again kind. This time he did fill out my FMLA papers and I left there with the intentions of never going back. I did end up going to another doctor that a friend had recommended and brought my MRI results with me. The new doctor also did x-rays and discovered there was a problem. I am now on my way to getting therapy and proper medication. I rarely write reviews good or bad however this time I felt the need to inform anyone who has intentions on going to this location. I know the others have really good reviews and I'm sure their encounter with the doctor went well. Mine did in the beginning too.

Why did I fire Dr. De Los Santos? Why will I never go to this clinic again? \n\nIn a nutshell: severe incompetence of doctors, poorly run clinic, rude receptionists, the walk in doctors are inexperienced and unprofessional, Dr. De Los Santos is extremely rude and unhelpful and appointments are unnecessarily rushed or rescheduled. \n\nOut of a nutshell: see stories below\n\nI am 27. In pretty great health. Maybe I would wind up here once every 4-5 months for something over a 2 and a half year span. Here are the stories of some of my visits:\n\nMy experiences with their walk-in doctors:\n\n1) Me seeing young female doctor\nMe: \"I have this bump on the inside of my finger\"\nYoung female: \"it feels like a ganglion cyst, you can google that and look up some treatment options\" \nMe: \"I'm sorry, google it? \nYoung female: \"yes, there are videos on how to smash it with different objects, like a book.\" \nMe: \"I googled that before I came here and it is supposed to be dangerous\" \nYoung female: \"well, you could just wait to see if it goes away. There isn't really anything we do for it here.\" \n\n2) Me seeing middle-aged male doctor\nMe: \"So, I dropped a weight on my toe. Went to the hospital and they x-rayed and it's not broken but the swelling is so bad I can't even lower my foot, let alone put weight on it, because it feels like my toe is going to explode\" \nMale dr: \"you need physio therapy. My buddy works over across the hall. I'll set you up with him, he'll take care of you.\"\nMe: \"they said at the hospital that I would need a hole drilled in the nail to relieve pressure and that any family doctor could do it. That's why I came here.\"\nMale dr: \"no, physio is what you need\"\n\n(2 weeks of agony and very expensive physio later with this doctor's \"buddy\" my the skin around my toe starts blistering with blood pockets and I go to my physiotherapist appointment):\n\nPhysio guy: \"whoa...that's not good. I don't think I should treat you while it's like that, let me get my doctor friend to take a look\"\n(He brings in the same male doctor from my walk in appointment) \nMake dr: \"oh wow, you need to have a hole drilled in the nail to drain that\" \n\n(I lost the nail in my toe which could have been prevented by relieving the pressure early.)\n\n3) Me seeing a young male doctor:\nMe: \"I am pretty sure I have a yeast infection.\"\nYoung male: \"oh. Ok. Well...we can uh..well we can do a quick pap, I guess. Um.. Ya. Ok. Is that what you want? Does that..I mean, that's probably the best idea. \"\nMe: \"ya...ok\"\n\n(He pushed my thighs further apart instead of asking me to do it then did the usual stuff but then took out the speculum and put two fingers in my vagina and felt around like he was looking for my g-spot. I've had someone feel around for abnormalities, but this was like i was getting fingered. I have never had a pap that included that sort of nonsense. I have never felt more uncomfortable in my life.)\n\nSo...needless to say, I stopped going to the walk in. I thought I would stick with Dr. De Los Santos (my Family dr).\n\nThen came the referrals. Referrals for everything. Sometimes 5 minute rushed appointments and 1-3 referrals elsewhere, every time I went. I am in general good health by the way, just low iron and some allergies (hence all the blood tests). I have been rudely rushed out of my appointments and felt like I was an absolute inconvenience for being there.\n\nThen I made an appointment with De Los Santos to get results for allergy tests. The clinic is a 3 minute drive from my place down Strachan. (Silly to drive, I know, but it was a freezing day in winter). I left about 10 minutes early. (Always plenty of time). Then bam, I get behind a truck that is trying (and failing) to back up into a parking lot, blocking the whole street. It was taking forever so I called to let them know that I would be late possibly. The receptionist asked how long and I said, maybe 2 minutes, it won't be much. She said \"ok, that's fine.\" I park in an open spot and run in. Yay! I am only 1 minute late. I wait at reception for probably another minute (with one person in line in front of me and three people behind the desk, I might add). I finally hand them my health card and a nurse comes over and says, \"oh, Dr. De Los Santos has already taken another patient since you were late. You'll have to reschedule. If it's an emergency you can see a walk-in doctor.\" At this point it is 3 minutes past my appointment time. I was just livid. \n\nNever, ever, ever again will I go back there. I don't care if you can instantly heal the blind and make them see, no one has the right to treat people the way she does. And the other doctors there should still be under the supervision of someone who knows what they are doing.", "cool": 0, "date": "2014-07-21", "funny": 5, "review_id": "5GbXa7pk-Oq1mrqvGBe-Zw", "business_id": "jSm10odmxWoEs0l2CSqang", "stars": 1, "user_id": "KlNPKn3Y8pjyQvsS9zQuyg", "useful": 8}, {"text": "This place is awesome! great tasting juice & the employees are always nice & knowledgeable.", "cool": 0, "date": "2015-10-29", "funny": 0, "review_id": "h79Fwub9MERPJe339w6Wtw", "business_id": "aYfHXWNjLNUVoQa5CMA2jg", "stars": 5, "user_id": "hBmJs49zYcXdV4wo8F5iiA", "useful": 0}, {"text": "Paul says he's semi-retired, so I almost hate to review him, but he really was fantastic.

My family has been going to the downtown location for a long long long time. We couldn't be happier when we knew they have a second location at Bayview Village, since it's our favourite mall and it's closer to our home. The food and the service are excellent. We go there almost every Sunday; sometimes for Dim Sum, sometimes for dinner. \n\nIt's suprised to see they were temporarily closed due to some health issue few weeks ago. I checked their inspection history on DineSafe. They got a green on April 7, and about a month later, they got a red. How bad things would go in just a month? Since we shop around the mall quite often, we know the managers in all the restaurants quite well. Pearl's managers as well of course. \n\nThey told me because the Public Health Department received a complaint from just one customer, saying she didn't feel well after eating at Pearl. There are a lot of reasons to cause one person felt sick. I hope the Health Department checked all the restaurants that she went to on those days. \n\nIt seems to me maybe the inspector thought it's a slap in his face that he passed the restaurant not long ago, and then someone felt sick after eaten there. One of the owners of Aroma espresso bar said they got a yellow one month after their opening. That's quite funny to me. How unsanitized they can get for a month?\n\nI believe in Bayview Village and Pearl. As the upscale shopping mall in North York, Bayview Village won't allow any restaurant to put customers' health in risk. They must have their professional cleaning and pest control team to ensure the great health conditions. As for Pearl, they had been in the industry for so many years. I think they know about what sanitized environment means.

What better way to cap off your spa treatment with a refreshing sweat treat? But this review is about Mozaik. If you don't already know, they're a full-service spa with everything under one very hip roof: massage, facials, mani/pedi, hair cut & color. This is a big plus. Who wants to drive from place to place in Scottsdale's oppressive 3,000 degree summer heat? Not me. I booked a fax wax, 90-minute massage and color. FACE WAX: I was long over-due. The peach fuzz had to be expunged. Karina took her time, waxing a small area at a time. She took the sting out by applying pressure on the newly waxed skin with her fingers. A++ for NOT ripping off any skin. MASSAGE: Full disclosure: I am a massage aficionada. I have long known the benefits of a good massage, and have actually gotten off the table after 5 minutes of a bad one! Why waste my time and money? Kristina is the masseuse. Love her tats! The room was the perfect temperature. Soothing music. Really comfy table, and especially comfy face thingy. OMG A++. Killer good back, shoulder and head massage. The girl can knead! COLOR: Eva is a gem. Her own hair is her calling card, and testament to her brilliance! My hair is very resistant to color, and the color and developer I had been using was just not working for me. A rich auburn has always been elusive. The color would fade a week after application. The frustration brought me to my knees. Eva assessed the situation. She used 10 instead of 20 developer, and mixed two colors to finally, FINALLY give me the color I always wanted. She even brought me outside so I could see the true color in all its glory. A+++.

The guy started by cutting my perfect Acrilics nails taking them off (hurt like hell) the owner/manager came by saying \"beauty hurts hahaha\" I asked why he was removing, I did not understand what he said, then when he was done with the cuticles, he brought he gel colors for me to choose and I said that I did not want to put gel anymore because he had already removed the nails and now I just wanted regular polish. The owner/manager came back and they both started insisting that I had to do the gel and I finally said NO! And explained that I did not get what I wanted in the first place so I wanted the simplest thing. So they accepted - after lots of insistence - and for the first time ever I did not tip.
