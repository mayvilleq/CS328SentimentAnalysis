One stylist actually turned me away because my natural hair intimidated her. I haven't had a haircut since I was a child and I've had anxiety with anyone touching my hair (bad experience from a relaxer at 13 that left me with a bald spot). \n\nI needed a haircut because 1) it was getting too hard for me to manage 2) split ends that was hampering growth and 3) I was going to be on Katie Couric's show. I looked up natural curly salons in Vegas and found Hair Artisans. I called them first and asked how they cut natural hair because that would determine whether they knew what they were doing or not. When Danielle said they cut it dry I immediately felt good about my decision to go ahead and book an appointment. \n\nI came in the following day with the beast unleashed, I felt apprehensive because I didn't want to be turned down again. Rather than feeling intimidated, everyone at the salon were amazed with my hair. To them it was gorgeous, to me it was still a beast. Danielle co-consulted with me while I waited for Arlene who was to cut my hair and discussed what needed to be done with my unshapely, unruly natural hair. She made me feel comfortable and dispelled my worries. To put my hair in perspective, when stretched it reached my waist. Apparently, I have different textures too so the back would be really tightly curly and thick while the front would have bigger curls. I couldn't wear my hair out because it looked like a bird's nest - no shape and it was too long and big. \n\nArlene arrived and immediately got to work. I was just so happy they didn't turn me down. She cut off the \"see-through\" ends and layered my hair to give it shape. She then shampooed, conditioned, and detangled my hair, which I felt so bad for because it's almost like punishment to have to detangle my hair. However, they seemed to enjoy it. Danielle and Arlene tag-teamed during styling showed me the process of shingling which further defined the shape and curls. \n\nI was so happy to see the end result AND to finally be able to wear my hair out. I felt like a D-I-V-A afterward. They recommended products for me to put on my hair, and for a college student, the products were affordable. The whole process was only $40! I couldn't believe it. Of course, I tipped them generously. I'm so grateful to them. I enjoyed my experience and am extremely happy of the outcome. I've never received so many compliments and likes on Facebook after I posted the new hair style. Sooooo happy! Definitely will be going back to them.

I had such good memories of my previous meal here... 15 years ago!  I wasn't disappointed. My husband and I shared a platter of assorted mezzes. Everything was very tasty. The ros\u00e9 wine we drank with it was very good.  Definitely a nice prelude to a visit to March\u00e9 Jean Talon. Ah, Montr\u00e9al, I miss you!  We will have to try Alep next time we are in town.", "date": "2010-08-20", "cool": 0, "user_id": "5Uv5ekKsOOL4rX0Zsmzfpw", "business_id": "_Ac-WT9RXqmAHEfTKIlFfQ", "stars": 4}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "UI715LHPlrYEhJM7UwmgkQ", "text": "Had 2 fillings a couple days ago.

I made the reservation through Costco and got a great deal; and was able to use my Costco confirmation number on the Alamo website to utilize their \"skip the counter\" feature.  Printed out the necessary document prior to my trip and went straight to the rental garage after we arrived at the rental center.  There was an Alamo representative right there who took us to the row of our category vehicle and told us to pick anyone.  After we were loaded in, we noticed the gas tank wasn't full.  The attendant told us to let the person at the exit gate know, who would note on our contract what the gas level was (3/4 tank).  The exit gate attendant did one better - he noted in the computer that we paid for gas ahead of time and told us we did not have to fill the car up before we returned it.  The car was fine - a Jeep Compass, it was clean and worked well.  The return was super quick and smooth and indeed there was no problem with us bringing the car back with less than a full tank.  I love the expediency of the skip the counter feature and will always use Alamo just for that.

So first with the positive. The palace tower room was gorgeous. I got upgraded to a suite and I never wanted to leave the room. The decor was modern yet functional. Lots of space - like 700-800 sq feet. There were two bathrooms - one with just a sink and toilet, the other with a sunken in jacuzzi tub and toilet with a bidet. The bathrooms were adjoined by a shower with dual shower heads. Disappointing there was no free in-room coffee or tea. Had to pay like $15 for it.\n\nThere are lots of restaurants and shops at The Forum in Caesar's Palace. You don't even really need to leave the property.\n\nNow on to the bad. Check in was terrible. First my room wasn't ready when I arrived at 1 pm. Fine they held my bag and were supposed to call by 3 pm when it was ready. They never called so I went to the front desk at 4 pm and they gave me my room key. Right when  I walked in the room reeked of smoke though I asked for a non-smoking room. I called the front desk and they tried to move me way across the hotel. I refused so thy finally gave me the min suite in the palace tower. So once I had my room I was fine but he check in was just awful.\n\nMy friend checked into her room via text from her email confirmation and just walked up to the bell desk to get her keys & she checked in early. So that's probably your best bet because the front desk check in was bad.", "date": "2010-11-21", "cool": 0, "user_id": "zj2xftUYPhMCJcNrPO3frg", "business_id": "VyjyHoBg3KC5BSFRlD0ZPQ", "stars": 3}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "r8Ixi0VKDN0grmapi-zwQA", "text": "Had the queso Frito, and highly recommend it.
