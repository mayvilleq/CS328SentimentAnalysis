We tried the chimichanga and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.... We actually did 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef (have you EVER been to a place that will make a burrito half and half? i havent!) The meat has fantastic flavor. I'm not a beef girl but i'd order a whole plate of their beef - its that good. The chimichanga was HUGE enough for both of us to share it (and my husband also had a beef taco which also was delicious) and we were FULL and it was $11 total with drinks. YOu cant beat that.\n\nTHe service was great. The server was so nice and attentive- you could tell she was the owner. \n\nThe only thing I'd change is their chips they serve.

Or, in this case, a bar by its' signage. Let's face it, I'm a sucker for good signage. And Souz Dal has it. The rusty globe hangs outside like a relic, the name of the bar cut into the side. Lit, and glowingfrom within, it reminds me of one of those tin punch-out crafts made from a (insert random legume) canat summer camp. But much cooler of course. It was this sign that caught my attention on more than one occasion, beckoning me in when I had somewhere else to be. Finally, one night a couple of weeks ago, I gave in to its sirens call. I was a little bit disappointed.\n\nIt was devoid of people save for us and the lonely bartender. I say lonely, butjudging by his charm (see: none) he probably liked it better thatway. Granted though, it was early - Souz Dal only has a drink menu - and a few more folk trickled in as the night wore on.\n\nThe stars I gave are attributed solelyto the bar's ambience. Dimly lit, and painted in muted reds and oranges it has an earthy orMoorish feel to it. Worn textiles and cathedral mirrors adorn the walls, while candles flicker on every table, casting shadows. The back patio has a similar vibe happening, cloistered in by high walls, andlit by candles wedged in the mouths of old wine bottles.\n\nNow I rarely turn down a good patio, but in this case I chose aseat inside, which says a lot.Reclined on velvet benches at our table by the open front window, we watched College Street come alive as we perused the drink menu. I was in a cocktail mood, and my friend had read somewhere that Souz Dal claimed to have the \"best\" mojitos in the city, so that was the first order I placed. \n\nNow I've been to Cuba. I did a little backpacking, starting in Havanaand makingmy way to the South coast. I wouldn't say I'm a connoiseur of the mojito because of this, but I diddrink my fair share, and like to think I know a thing or two about a good one. And this wasn't one of them. There wasn't nearly enough mint or sugar, so it was overwhelmingly bitter. I don't like my mojitos to taste like Kool-Aid, but I do like a little sweetness to curb the edge. \n\nUnlikely to order another of the same, but unwilling to give up on the bar, we tried a few other beverages. Nothing wowed us. The Moscow Mule with its ginger beer offered a nice slow burn, but it also wasn't a repeat offender. The fortune cookie garnish on the lychee-infused Soho martini was fun, but not nearly as tasty as a lychee would have been. \n\nAlthough funky signage and ambience mean a lot to me, a good drink means even more, so chancesare Iwon't be returning to Souz Dal. If however, you are in the market for an intimate date setting (see: empty bar) then head on over. And if a mediocre mojito is your thing, then you can get them herefor $5.75 on Mondays.", "stars": 2, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2011-08-20"}, {"user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "review_id": "Wcquaa9O-kUULSFeV38hFQ", "funny": 1, "business_id": "d_Go5TsiFMIRtCE6XS8Sjw", "text": "Located at the top of the restaurant strip on Roncesvalles, The Westerly is a cozy neighbourhood spot that is sure to please.  The uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'. Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.\n\nWe spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.\n\nAfter a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon & smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.\n\nWhen the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.\n\nBetween the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.\n\nAmazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.\n\nI would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).

Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's \"Eat Drink Man Woman\", and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.\n\nThree hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...\n\nMomofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC & Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.\n\nWith the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.\n\nAs you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.\n\nFirst we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!\n\nNext came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!\n\nWe then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and crudit\u00e9; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.\n\nAnd then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.\n\nLastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,\n\nWe decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.\n\nAll in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic.

Yes, it is completely pitch-black, and no, your eyes will not eventually adjust. You can't see a dam thing down there in O.Noir's dark and dingy basement dining room.\n\nSeriously though, O.Noir is easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Toronto, not just because the food and service were awful, but also because I left the place feeling ripped off. O.Noir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it. It was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights off.\n\nFirst off, the food at O.Noir is horrible. It's just glorified, hotel banquet food. You know the stuff: salad with balsamic vinaigrette, pre-cooked steam-table-held vegetables, chicken with coriander sauce. It was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s; there's nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here. The food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light. You'd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight, they'd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses, like food with strong aromas or flavours. Nope. Just unthoughtful, crappy food. In a way, the food was so bad that I'm glad my other senses weren't heightened by the lack of light.\n\nI ordered the 'surprise' menu. I mean really, why wouldn't I? I'd like to at least try to see if I could use my 'enhanced' senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was I was eating... For me, the 'surprise' was that I still don't know what the hell I ate. No one ever told me. I sort of assumed that once we were finished eating, the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions, but nope, he just took our plates away without any explanation at all.\n\nSpeaking of our server, he was one of the worst in the biz. Not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up, but he was inattentive and bored; I don't blame him though, it'd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of O.Noir. He often left us wondering where he was, not because we were in the dark, but because he often left the room or crept up behind us.\n\nThe seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too, especially if you're part of a group. In a dark environment, you'd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation. Our seating arrangements at a long, rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alone.\n\nSitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too. Believe it or not, the servers actually signal that they're entering the room by banging on the door. We must have heard it 40 or 50 times. In a room that is supposed to heighten your senses, this seems absolutely ridiculous. Surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters. If there is, O.Noir didn't figure it out, or they didn't care. They just decided to stick with the loud banging.\n\nAlthough we couldn't see anything, a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotel-style metal chairs and wooden tables. I mean, I know we can't see anything anyways, but if our senses were supposed to be heightened, then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that. You could argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant doesn't need to spend as much on the space, but I'd argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into consideration.\n\nOn the way out, the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel, and right then, it all made sense to me; this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel. It explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture. It confirmed one thing for me: if you're going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark, then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose. There's little doubt that because they didn't, O.Noir sees little repeat business. People come for the novelty, but likely leave disappointed.\n\nO.Noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that. The pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway.

When I was there, the place was cramped and full of hungry people, but everyone was in good spirits. \n\nWhen I look at the menu, i always find it difficult to make a choice. They've got a big, diverse menu with both savory and sweet items. All of it looks delicious.  \n\nFirst off, I'm a vegetarian, but, like to get the breakfast pocket, sans pemeal bacon of course.  It's chock full of fluffy eggs, caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun. Aunties and Uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides, but I've never chose anything but the potato salad. Seriously, this stuff is good. A great combo of chunky red potatoes, dill, Dijon and spices, it's savoury and creamy. Admittedly, my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive, so if you go, don't go when you're in a hurry.\n\nFruit juices and iced teas are good choices, but I wouldn't finish off with an espresso as they may suggest. Their espresso is nothing special and just plain weak, and it certainly doesn't stand up to Manic coffee located just a few doors down. If you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, I'd suggest you head over to Manic.\n\nAunties and Uncles loses points in service.

You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.\n\nI'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong. \n\nLa Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nBut one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it. \n\nPerfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.\n\nOn this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.\n\nSeriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West.

Well no, it isn't, but that's exactly how I wanted to start this off. Man, I really wanted to love this place.

When I was first drawn by the interesting front stained-glass window and poked my head inside to look around, I figured that in no-time-at-all, there'd be a lineup to get in. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be the case anytime soon.\n\nLa Revolucion is a Mexican restaurant, but at first glance, it certainly doesn't scream Mexican; after eating there, I'm not even sure that's what they're going for. It's a sparsely decorated joint that for some reason--at least while I was there--feels the need to distance themselves even more from their Mexican roots by blasting annoyingly loud rave music. I mean, their food is the typical, standard Mexican fare you'd expect, like enchiladas and tacos and burritos, but other than that and the few Mexican-esque decorations, there wasn't much Mexican about it at all.\n\nThey're heavily pushing the banditos aspect of Mexican culture, which is actually a pretty cool gimic in my eyes. While I get the whole concept of banditos and revolution, it seemed as though La Revolucion fell a little short of their delivery of the theme. While what little decor they have there is mostly bandito-related, the rest of the theme is left to interpretation. La Revolucion does feel as though they're finding their identity, but they have a lot of difficulty conveying what that identity is exactly to their guests. Sitting there, it doesn't feel as though you were part of the revolution, it feels as though you're interrupting them while they plan it, and they can't wait for you to leave so they can get back down to business.\n\nPresentation isn't their strong point either. They haphazardly slap the food down on the plate, without much concern for appearances. My enchiladas were slightly warm and covered in tasteless green salsa; my burrito was humungous, but it was bland and not nearly warm enough. When I asked for hot sauce, because it was nowhere to be found, I got a small ramekin with some sort of sauce, but it's details remained a mystery that was left for me to find out with no explanation from the server, and while you're waiting for that stuff to all arrive, there's no offer of chips and salsa or even water for that matter, which would have definitely improved the experience.\n\nInterestingly enough, before this place was a Mexican place it was, well, a Mexican place. Whoever it is that owns it probably just decided it was time to rebrand, and while that may have been a great idea on their part, the execution of their new brand and concept needs some polishing because it's hard to tell exactly what the concept is.

With the exception of the Firkin on Runnymede, Dark Horse has one of the biggest and best outdoor spaces in the village to drink pints, people watch or eat burgers and fries.\n\nBut, as many people have pointed out before me, the service can range anywhere from slow to crappy when you're sitting out there. While you're waiting, you may even be waiting so long for service that you'll feel compelled to go inside and get your own drinks, which causes the server to give you attitude when she eventually gets to your table, which causes you to feel uncomfortable; you see the vicious circle taking shape here...\n\nAll-in-all, the food at Dark Horse isn't half bad. Granted, they aren't going to win any awards anytime soon, but for pub food that goes well with a few drinks, it's pretty decent. While some of the food, like the calamari and nachos, is previously frozen and highly unimaginative, other items, like their Village Burger or fish and chips, are clearly made in-house and truly tasty. They also serve a weekend brunch that is worth checking out, but expect to wait for a table; it fills up quickly with the neighbourhood locals.\n\nAll of the expected draft options are here...I think. Truth-be-told, the server never actually rattled off the draft list to us in the limited time she spent at our table. Luckily, there were a few beer-branded signs in the patio, which makes the process a little easier, but a lot less convenient.\n\nDark Horse's problems are easily fixable; they just need a bit more staff. Trust me, sit back on the patio, have a pint, and watch them work. It'll quickly become obvious that they're understaffed.

If anything, those details make it better and much more comfortable.\n\nThere really isn't that much for food here. They've got a couple of items that are fairly easy for the lone person working to make when the place gets busy, which it definitely does. Mostly it's just the standard pressed sandwich kind of thing. No soup, no fries, no salad, as a side anyways. The friendly guy working there told me that it's not that kinda place. He said that it's mostly a cafe and a place to drink booze.\n\nThe menu is up on a chalkboard, and like I mentioned, it mostly has pressed sandwiches, like grilled cheese with apples and Tandoori chicken stuffed Naan bread. The sandwiches certainly aren't bad, but sadly, the majority of the stuff they make seems to have been brought in with little of it made in-house, like the Naan bread. The Naan was the kinda stuff pressed and packaged somewhere distant, and then bought at some grocery retail giant. It definitely would have been better if they worked with someone local to get some truly authentic stuff. They do have quite a few baked goods too. I'm not sure if those were made in-house or not, but they look nice next to a cup of the great coffee they serve.\n\nI've seen some pictures of brunch items at Holy Oak, like eggs Benny, but based on when I was there I couldn't see that happening.

An easy walk from the Rosedale subway stop, we went the evening of the Stanley Cup final, expecting the place to be packed, but managed to find comfortable high-top seating, and friendly service, amidst a fairly busy night.\n\nThe Rebel House is a small pub, with a quaint upstairs section, where we sat. Several TV's aired the hockey game, and there was an eclectic mix of people, some older, into their 50's, but predominantly a mix of twenty and thirtysomething young professionals and students.\n\nThe menu is varied, but small, although they offer a revolving door of several daily specials that seem to be based on season and availability, which is always a good bet.\n\nMy dining partner decided to go with the daily special Mussels ($14), absolutely delicious in a white wine and garlic sauce, with toasted garlic bread. I ordered the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies ($10), small appetizer-sized cheese patties, with nary a spinach leaf in sight...nor were they spicey. No matter. These delightful little morsels were crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and came with a delectable tomato chutney and sour cream to top with. At our server's suggestions, I also ordered the Spinach and Apple Salad ($6), with cheddar cheese, toasted almonds, and a homemade maple dressing on the side. A wonderful combination. In fact, we liked the cheese pennies so much, we ordered another batch, only to find that that a repeat order isn't always as good the second time around. These pennies were so thick with grease, I found myself soaking up the oil slick with a napkin just to get them down. I think ordering a third time might have settled this dilemma for good, but for now I choose to remember the experience based on my initial encounter with the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies; delightful.\n\nMy dining partner, an \"adventurous\" drinker himself, ordered a Labatt Blue, but it did come in the extra large bottle, which made him smile from ear to ear. I ordered the Henry of Pelham Pinot Noir to start, but must admit that it tasted watered down and a bit weak. Not to be discouraged, I tried the 2006 Cabernet Franc Special Reserve VQA after dinner, and was pleasantly surprised by one of the nicer glasses of wine I have had at a pub in some time.

The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only d\u00e9cor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.\n\nSavoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.\n\nNow, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it.

In fact, Buster's Sea Cove isn't even in the same boat. At Buster's, you won't find soft lighting, romantic ambience, or table-side service, but what you're pretty much guaranteed to find, is some killer seafood served up really, really quickly.\n\nFresh-made fish and chips are the staple in this place, but they've got so much more than that. Their huge menu has everything from crab cakes and clam strips to fried oysters and fish-topped salads. And their fish-type sandwiches, something that they happen to do really, really well, are outstanding.

Pachuco opened its doors on Friday, January 13th, perhaps a sign of bad luck, but that shouldn't hinder their success.\n\nPachuco is a small (read: reservations) and cozy space, with exposed brick walls, wrought-iron d\u00e9cor and, and a pretty impressive wall of wine bottles lit by a neon sign. Even though Pachuco shares a kitchen with older brother and Danforth favourite  Embrujo Flamenco, they definitely serve up their own distinctive flavour.\nTheir menu is well thought out and varied, with an excellent selection of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. Their appetizer menu alone is worth the trip. With a confident boasting of guacamole flavours, including goat cheese, blue cheese, smoked trout and walnut, and a guacamole sampler patter that allows you to try three of their creations, there is seemingly no end to the interesting flavour combinations. We decided to stick to our guns, however, and go with the traditional guacamole, which was a stellar choice; lots of lime, onion and creamy avocado, but with no flavour left too overpowering. Their homemade tortilla chips have to be mentioned as well: crisp and tasty. I am hoping they will one day provide these in a to-go bag for purchase before you leave. We also ordered the Chile poblana, swathed in an excellent and perfectly spicy tomato sauce, with queso fresco and refried beans, all baked perfectly. The portion size on both entrees was more than enough for two people, and it could easily serve as a great entr\u00e9e.\n\nFor our meals (both $15) we went with the Taquitos de Machaca (coffee and ancho braised beef brisket, with guacamole and honey chipotle salsa), and the pre-Hispanic delicacy of Taquitos de Huitlacoche (corn truffle, onions, jalape\u00f1o peppers, Cazuela beans served with reques\u00f3n-avocado salsa). Where to start? Let's save the most interesting for last. The braised beef was well cooked and well spiced, the chipotle salsa was a great added touch, and one order of beans and rice between the two of us was more than enough to share. In fact, we both left incredibly full. Their fresh-this-second corn tortillas are amazing, sweet, soft and still warm from the press, prepared just the way you would expect to find them in a traditional Mexican eatery. The Huitlacoche, however, was an adventure in and of itself. \n\nFor those who don't know (myself included), Huitlacoche is a fungus, which grows naturally on corn in damp environments. The fungus is harvested and has been consumed as a delicacy for centuries in Central and South America cuisine. When it arrived, it tasted smokey and earthy; it looked like a dark mash of black corn, onion- and was that a jalape\u00f1o in there? Hard to tell. The dish was good, but I can't say I would strongly recommend it. Overall, I found the food at Pachuco's to be mostly over-salted, and the Huitlacoche had to be the worst offender. This is the main reason why I would not order it again; although the flavour was very different from any other Mexican dishes I have tried, and I actually did enjoy it, I just could not get over the intensity of the salt. \n\nThe drinks and food at Pachuco's ranged from good to very good, and if they could tone down the salt (margaritas included), I would probably rate most of it as excellent. However, I cannot say our overall experience was excellent, but I would not fault them for it in my overall rating. Being that it was their opening weekend, one expects a few hiccups, and I am sure they will be cleared up by the time you visit. I was served the wrong meal at first, and we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for the Huitlacoche to be prepared, instead of the fish tacos, (though delightful looking), I was initially served. By the time my dish came around, the other half of our meal was cold. Our side plates and used cutlery were never removed from our table after we finished with our appetizers, and the tables are so small and cramped as it is, there was no room for our mains. Instead of removing our side plates, there was a vain attempt to stuff everything on the table. I eventually had to ask for fresh cutlery and removal of the used dishes from our table. Not once, but twice, we almost had our not-quite-finished drinks taken from us, and we had to ask a few times for extra tortillas. It seemed a little strange to me that you would only get four at a time, and as great as they were, they are very, very small, so I imagine each meal would require a minimum of 3 or 4 on its own. \n\nOverall, I think these are minor complaints, especially since it was Pachuco's opening preview. I found that the service was friendly and genuine, the restaurant was quaint and ambient, with Latin music, candles and a few kitschy d\u00e9cor details, which made it seem authentic and allow it to live up to it's self-proclaimed 'Modern Mexican' dining experience.", "stars": 4, "cool": 1, "useful": 4, "date": "2012-01-21"}, {"user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "review_id": "8enQ9Fj-sWkWub4AZQUzeQ", "funny": 4, "business_id": "1SnYDvrd02FXSXnIgz-9DQ", "text": "Huge Apple Danishes!

The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  \n\nTo be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would \"incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes\"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue \"fighting\".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. \n\nIf this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. \n\nIn short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.

And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.)\n\nI also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year)\n\nGo here get your hair done by an expert.

They have melted butter that you can scoop up to your hearts content and they have champagne in a glass now not in those cheapy plastic containers they do in other casinos. I like the salad selection and of course the choices in bread. I do not eat bread although I love bread because of the high carb content but enough about that. The bread had to be tried!

We were picked up from the Aria tour bus pickup area, which is underground. Once we picked up a few more people at Excalibur, we were whisked away and headed out of town. A surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures. After this, we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver. Alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test (whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back). All wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality, although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected (no wonder most people gets the red wrong). The first winery we visited was Pahrump Winery. One of the owners, Gretchen, was so very informative and enthusiastic. She was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked. Following a tour and wine tasting, we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch. This lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour. My wife and I, being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines (which I highly recommend). Some of the wines that weren't on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously. We picked out several of our tastings and Gretchen's friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home. We also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to Alan to load onto the bus for us. We were then on the road again and headed to the next winery, I would say that after the first winery, the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience, but I was to be mistaken. The second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and I both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket. As well, the tasting room was a bit \"homey\". I hope they can make it work eventually, but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop. On our way back, Alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink, but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time. I'm not entirely sure that Alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on. I would also encourage Alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing them...if someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery, the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine. Listen enthusiastically and respond positively. Aside from these notes, the tour is great for the value.

The bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.  (I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple. \n\nMy friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.\n\nI am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar. It was overall bland, I tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it; they turned out to be peanuts, which I don't love to begin with, but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what you're eating, you know that it's not very flavorful. The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING. I'm really sad there's no decent non-pizza places that deliver to my new apartment. \n\nFor a $50 delivery order, I was extremely disappointed.

He got really, really excited and I couldn't say no, so we purchased our final deal of the day, went and ran some errands, and finished off at Thai Buffet.\n\nWe were the only ones there at that time, but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch (I think we arrived around 4:15-ish).  The buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself, but it is all you can eat.

We couldn't say no to any of the dishes, they all looked super amazing.

I lived here for 6 years. We ALWAYS paid rent on time, were respectful neighbors to the community and responsible tenants. These apartments were great..... 5 years ago. What happened? If you are debating renting here, let me fill you in on what you are really in for. \n\n2 years ago the apartments sold to new owners. That was the downfall. Instead of taking care of upgrading appliances, upgrading the landscape for renters or properly managing maintenance requests; they chose to upgrade the front office and future tenant center to increase curb appeal. They chose to close down the main pool.... right before summer. The pool was closed for months. They offered no reimbursement whatsoever. When you sign a lease you are entitled to the amenities that were provided to you when you were shown the apartments. The mailbox lock hardly ever worked and was left open a lot. Car patrolled security (non-armed) that once existed, must have gotten cut because they were no where to be seen in past years by my eye. Apartment building security lights were left burned out even after MANY maintenance requests, which was CLEARLY a security issue. This last December, there was an armed robbery.... AT THE MAILBOX at 10pm! Two men jumped from the nearby bushed area with a gun and robbed a tenant. We no longer felt safe and it was (in my opinion) because of poor management with caring about the safety and well-being of it's tenants that were already moved in.\n\nOnce you're in, why do they have to care about your satisfaction and safety? You signed a lease and they know they have you locked in. In the last 2 years, our apartment has been flooded by the upstairs unit 3 times! The first was a faulty bathtub connection but the second time was due to a maintenance repair error (as stated by the maintenance man) and was repaired VERY poorly and took over a week to complete while we couldn't use our main bathroom. The third time (see video and pictures) was also a faulty connection to a washing machine after it had recently been replaced. The managment never apologized once for the inconvenience to flooding our apartment for the third time in two years. They also NEVER came back to fix the damage it left on the walls and pillars, as evident by the water stain on our ceiling and paint that was bubbled. The foundation for the apartment is shifting as well. There were huge cracks in our walls from who knows what. Our sliding door on our patio would no longer shut correctly because the door frame was warped from the building's unrepaired structure (multiple times we put in requests to see what was going on with this. Nothing was fixed, just noted on our maintenance record) \n\nSounds great, right? There's more. So you can see how unprofessional they are, but how about unethical? They started bribing tenants to put in \"5 star\" reviews on yelp to get entered into raffles for iPods and other prizes. They also, recently, started asking new tenants to put in \"5 star\" reviews to get some fees taken off their move in costs. If you ran a sound business with great satisfaction, you wouldn't need to bribe people into giving you 5 star reviews, would you? Shame on any business that does this. And last, but not least, we are (at the time of writing this review 4/15/16) still waiting for our security deposit. Like I said, we ALWAYS paid rent on time, for 6 years! And the one time we are LEGALLY due our deposit IN FULL within 30 DAYS of moving out (Nevada States Law NRS 118A.242), it has not arrived. We have called Jessi, the manager, multiple times and never received a call back from her. We received one email stating the refund has been \"processed\" but still no update on the status or postage date.They tell us they are short staffed and sound really sad on the phone but guess what? You are a business! Act like it. Don't make excuses, just fix issues. If I were to tell them 2 years ago that I had some personal problems and couldn't pay rent (which never happened, just example given) would they let me pay late or maybe within 7-10 business days? NO! They would have fined me and eventually evicted us if they didn't receive payment. These are not even all the issues we experienced but this about sums up our time there. It is not right that businesses don't care about the tenants after they have signed a lease because they know they have them locked. We should have moved out 2 years ago, that was our fault for staying so long. But we have now moved into a new apartment with better appliances and staff, 24hr armed security car patrol, maintenance requests that were taken care of within the same day... all for the same price we paid there! Do yourself a favor and look around and judge for yourself. I can tell you that we feel like Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption when he finally swims through the sewage drain and is free.

I did in fact enroll my child for the summer program the rates are high but I figured someone has to pay for the amazing aquarium that was mentioned in the previous review and it included snacks and 'breakfast & lunch' so I dove in!! \n\nWith MUCH push my husband finally agreed to let me pay the fees which included a enrollment fee of 150 plus the first week, (you are charged weekly on Fridays) I chose to put my child on an easy-pay system where they would pull out weekly for his tuition Mistake 1. The first week they charged us our normal tuition plus enrollment fee (183 for 3 days mon, wed, fri & 150 enrollment) then no less than 3 days later they charged us again! This being our first week my husband and I were a little taken aback but we figured eh maybe a fluke,  after addressing the issue with  Kaylee we were told \"no worries, well note your account and we just wont charge you for next week\" great I thought lets move forward then 3 days later ANOTHER charge now I was getting a little annoyed.\n\nI don't know your financial situation but the tuition is high so these accidental charges were starting to hurt after the 3rd accidental charge. Again I went to the office and spoke with Angela the finance director and I told her we were a little concerned we had only been attending one week and already had been charged for 3 weeks plus enrollment. I kindly asked for a refund as I didn't mind waiting for the first accidental charge to catch up, I was more than a little peeved about the other charges. I talked to Selena and she told me that I needed to bring in my credit card statement that showed the charges...Lol I wasn't lying. Don't they keep records of what they are charging peoples cards!!\nAngela tells me SUUUUURE you can have a refund in 6-8 weeks!!!! 6-8 weeks because your finance department cant keep its records straight? I snatched up my easy pay document so fast she had a paper cut!!! \n\nSo I let it go AGAIN (really didn't have a choice we were 3 weeks in on charges) I continued to bring my son. When I would pick up my son the room was so hot I could smell the children's sweat but this is AZ heat so I figured man the AC must be working hard to keep this place cool and I would bring him at 8 so maybe they had just turned it on. \nOne of my biggest concerns was the child to teacher ratio, were talking 15 KIDS TO EVERY ONE TEACHER!!!! Why? because that's the minimum that the state will allow wouldn't you want your child to go to place that goes above a beyond the bare minimum? It was a ZOO when I would have to get him early. There was no less than 35 kids in the class at any given time. Great! I thought a great way for him to socialize with children his age. They called me less then 1 hour into his class saying that my son had attacked a little boy, when I went to get him thinking my son had mauled a little boy I was very upset he had never hit before, when I walked in he was sitting alone (I assume time out) which I am okay with but when I asked if the little boy was okay I looked he had a scratch the size of a sewing needle, not downplaying what my son did he should never hit but they are 5!!! They are learning they are going to get into scuffs.  My son came home on the 3rd day with a large scratch on his forehead I didn't say anything because I get it, they have scuffs and boys can be a little rough. After the 2nd time I chose to remove him from the program, just in time in my opinion I just got a letter saying they needed another 150  for supplies. Lol\nAcross the hall from my sons class was the infant room, my heart would break to see the infants crying with no one trying to console them. As a mother I know that some have no choice but to put their child in daycare and work but would you want your baby to be screaming because they aren't required to have more teachers in the class?. It just made me so sad to see this daily.   \n\nThe staff is SUPER UNFRIENDLY I actually stopped smiling to them because you know that feeling when you smile at someone and they look a you like you have gone mad smiling at them!!\n\nIn conclusion if you feel the need to enroll you must be okay with the following:\n\n1. Your child must NEVER make a mistake like get a little rough with another kid, if you work plan to miss a few days because you will be asked to come and get him\n\n2. Have an endless supply of money because they will need it. 150 enrollment, 150 for 'supplies' ( must be for the starbucks) plus tuition \n3. must be okay with unfriendly staff drop your kid and leave. \n4.Must be able to figure out their plans they don't tell you crap till day of!\n\nUPDATE: The school asked that I remove this post.....ugh I think not!!!!", "stars": 1, "cool": 4, "useful": 95, "date": "2013-07-12"}, {"user_id": "xg9PJEgX8ARHjitU1dgP_w", "review_id": "tsSqmOBEarX77lsjRfm09w", "funny": 1, "business_id": "EXlUUDk3d7jDFgrvvZ5YtA", "text": "I've been taking route 57 - Courtney Park for the past 6 years and it's been a disaster.

The lobster mashed potatoes had so much butter that it was pooling around the edges of the bowl.  One steak was overcooked, came out medium well instead of medium rare.  The server took it back and the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered to even cook both steaks again so we could eat together.  We felt it was handled appropriately and would easily have returned for future meals after this.  However, the steak never came out.  I asked the server after a long while to see if it may be ready.  She came back from the kitchen frazzled and said, \"it will be out but I don't have a time to give you.\"  Then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat, set it down, did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left. It was very fatty and appeared to be NOT the cut of meat (filet) that I had ordered.  It was over cooked, again.

Ive been going there since I was a toddler,  Ive been there more recently because we moved into the area. Im so disappointed. Not only is it expensive (which I was willing to deal with), but now I have to deal with a snooty staff that seems annoyed by every interaction or order. Maybe its because Trax is now out of the farming/customer service business and more into the Gas/Oil business? Oh well.

We were told that the room that they held for us were given to people that stayed longer and that our rooms were not guaranteed, even though we booked them about a year in advance.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  We told her we were part of a wedding party that had blocked a bunch of rooms, but they still didn't care.  When they said they had 2 rooms available, the rooms were in 2 separate buildings away from where the bride had wanted us to stay.  We told the lady where we wanted to stay and she said come back in a hour and they should be ready.\n\nWe came back exactly an hour later, only to be told they weren't ready yet.  The lady had us sit and wait 20 more minutes while she waited on a call back to make sure the rooms were clean.  They also had one room with a King bed and one room with 2 doubles, even though my friend and I had both booked rooms with King beds.  I let her have the King room, but once again, what's the point of reserving a room, if you aren't going to get what you asked for.\n\nMy room was okay.  I didn't have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe.  I did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running.  That was really loud.  Also, even though there are shades to keep the light out, it was still bright once the sun started to rise and that made me wake up way earlier than I wanted to.\n\nAfter the first day, my room was not cleaned by 3:00 p.m.  When I was getting ready to meet my friends, the cleaning lady came back around 3:30 p.m. and I told her I will be leaving soon and to come back.  On the day I was leaving, she knocked on my door at 9:00 a.m. to see when she could clean my room and I told her I was leaving today.  Shouldn't she know that?\n\nThe food at the Mexican restaurant and Marilyn's Cafe was just so-so.  We only ate there b/c there was noting else, but it wasn't that great.  I would have gone somewhere else, if there was something else close by.\n\nThe bar in the lobby would have been okay if it wasn't for the jazz music.  I'm not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it.  Also, the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous!!!  My friend and I ordered Shirley Temple's, which consist of Sprite and cherry flavor and they cost $4 each!!!!!!!!  What the heck!?  Also, a small bottle of water, about half the size of a regular bottle, was $4!!!  That is so ridiculous!\n\nThe pool was probably the only thing that wasn't that bad.  We were able to get lounge chairs both times we went to the pool.  I know people I was with were annoyed with the one waitress that was going around getting drink and food orders.  She was taking forever on some things and even gave food to the wrong people.  \n\nOn my last day, I had checked out and wanted to spend a few hours at the pool.  I went into the bathroom to change and I came out and put my stuff on the counter.  The cleaning lady was in there staring at me with an annoyed look, so I asked her if I was in her way.  She rudely said yes and I asked her if I should move to one side or something and she huffed out saying, something about coming back.  So uncalled for!!\n\nWhen it was time to leave, we asked the bellman to get us a cab and he waited about 10-15 mins until he called for one, which of course made us late to get to the airport.\n\nI definitely won't be staying at this hotel again.  I appreciate that my friend picked a  place to help all the wedding guests save money, but it was an awful experience.", "stars": 2, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "date": "2012-05-29"}, {"user_id": "0J5Zw0mU-U51MtT9IjGB-Q", "review_id": "gRNqaG-rUXs9PvGIAJvrLQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "H0xrqDnQuei14LAkjEeInA", "text": "I stayed here after seeing rooms for $6.00 on Expedia, I really was thinking the worst.

So much so that I feel obligated in writing my first Yelp review in the five years since I've been a member.. \n\nThis is how the story goes:\n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived on Saturday 8/26 to watch the Mayweather/McGregor fight. Prior to arriving we called ahead to ask for the cover prices. We were told $10 at 4pm then $20 at 5pm and $30 after 6pm. So fast forward to arriving at the entrance BEFORE 5pm and to my surprise we were told we had to pay $20 since it was beginning to get \"unexpectedly\" crowded. So after we agree to reluctantly pay the cover, we were then told by the hostess that we were highly unlikely to get a table/seats. Granted, this was after we had already payed the cover charge to get in fully expecting to at least be able to sit at the bar. As we enter we realize how insanely crowded it is with no open seats in sight. We could not even order drinks at the bar because it was so crowded. After a brief browse around the area we came to the conclusion that it was just too crowded and it wasn't worth it to stand for who knows how long and wait for open tables/seats. By then we're both irritated and decide to leave after a few minutes of searching for open seats and squeezing through the crowd. \n\nAt this point, we arrive back home (no more than 10 minutes from Sandbar). Still irritated by the fact I had spent $40 for feeling totally uncomfortable and for something I didn't even receive (watch the fight), I call Sandbar in hopes of receiving a refund. We speak to a woman and let her know our situation. She tells us that they should be able to refund us, however because it was too busy they wouldn't be able to do it that day and to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. We make sure to let her know that we would be able to drive back and show our receipt if that would make it easier, but she continues to encourage us to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. \n\nSo we call back the next day to speak to a manger, however we are told that the manager who handles refunds was not there and to call back tomorrow. \n\nSo then we call back the following day, and to our surprise the manager who handles refunds was still not there and that he would be in the next day.\n\nIt's now Tuesday, and thankfully the manager we are waiting to speak to, Steve, is finally in. My girlfriend explains the situation and how we've been waiting days to speak to him and get our refund. Initially, Steve offers to give us a $40 gift card, however at this point we just want our money back. Steve tells my girlfriend he will call her back to let her know his verdict. Finally he calls back and VERY RUDELY tells her that he is NOT going to refund our money and even goes as far to take the $40 gift card off the table. He tells her that at this point, if we are going to want a refund, we must call corporate and immediately hangs up the phone. \n\nSo officially pissed off at this point, I call corporate and leave a message with Natalie explaining the situation. She tells me that I should receive a call back tomorrow. And now the waiting game begins.....\n*This review will be updated as soon as I hear back from someone.*\n\nNOTE: This entire situation has been a mess, and if the owners/leaders of this establishment had any sense of integrity towards their patrons, they would make this right!", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 3, "date": "2017-08-30"}, {"user_id": "sJBIwUCbDydz3Y1NTS_cmA", "review_id": "REqc6l5_n1Lfch5BpIBvTw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "6OmTD7FvQnnQqO-0CJu53w", "text": "This place is clean and sanitary from what I saw; however, customer service is also very important and the interactions that I experienced was not great.

My friend and I went to this Whole Foods this past Friday and had the worst experience. While standing in the area by the spring water, my 2yo was fussing. I noticed a customer and the cashier looking at us. The customer shook her head and turned back to the cashier and made a motion with her hand smacking her lips. The cashier laughed and made a motion cupping one hand and back hand smacking the cupped hand with his other hand. They looked at us again and the customer kept talking while she was frowned up. \n\nI went to them and said I know you're not implying I smack my child. They just looked; the customer still frowned up. As I walked away my friend still stood there and said they kept looking at us while making comments. \n\nAfter this we spoke with the supervisor who claimed she was the highest in rank there. She seemed to not care because she said I'll talk to him nonchalantly. She said I could go online to get in touch with the corporate office since I wasn't satisfied with her response. She also gave us a card and pen to fill out with comments about the store only to later come back and say she needed the pen back because that was the only one they had. \n\nBefore leaving we talked with a cashier who pointed out the manager to us. Then the cashier who was making the motions with his hands came to where we were and started talking to us saying he has a 5yo so he knows how children act up. Obviously the supervision said something to him. He had an attitude and said he wouldn't be talking to a customer about another customer and we had mistaken the whole thing. \n\nOnce leaving we talked to the manager about the hand gestures the cashier and customer made. He said he's worked with the cashier for years and he wouldn't do anything like that. He claimed the cashier smacks his hands a lot while talking and that when he came over to us told he apologized for his hand gestures. I told the manager our conversation was over because the cashier never mentioned anything about his hand gestures and only had excuses, not an apology. \n\nIt's nice to know that the Whole Foods staff sticks together no matter what from the top on down. I will find out if Corporate sticks by this kind of foolishness. \n\nOh...

I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. \n After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. \nMost sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10\" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4\"x6\". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews.

An example is, the mutton (sheep) is bought on the Navajo Nation.

Not exactly a cozy intimate dinner spot, still retains that fast-foody 'get in, eat, get out' atmosphere of most places on Green.\n\nIn order to get a good cross-sample I ordered the mixed grill. Wait was a solid 15 minutes, and there was a steady trickle of customers the whole time (during spring break, I imagine they will be busier during school). The menu said they had hot tea but I saw none in evidence, just a soda fountain, cold bottle drinks behind the counter, and an iced tea server.\n\nGot the food to go and got back to the office. The chicken (shish tawook) was perfectly done, which for white meat at an understaffed restaurant (they had help wanted signs in the window) is a mark in their favor. The beef was also well done and mildly flavorful but not quite the explosion of spiciness that Layalina provides. The kufta kabob was also mild and well-cooked. Nothing was dry or tasteless, the pita bread was fresh, the two sides they give you, one was some kind of jerusalem salad that was 90% tomatoes so I passed on it after taking one bite for review purposes (yup, tomtaoey. Yuck. The things I do for you people) and the other was this odd, neon-pink pickled... something. Not cabbage, not radish, not sure what it was. Its not on the menu. I ate it anyway. It was... pickled radishy but not too strong. Serving sizes were more than enough for lunch unless you're super hungry, I was and still felt full about halfway in but it was good enough that by picking at it over the course of an hour I managed to finish everything but the pita.\n\nThe rice was a little on the oily side but good if again, not as spiced as Layalina. All in all this was a nice, freshly-cooked, healthy meal for a great price. I've heard the owners are Afghani so its possible the food is a milder form than I'm used to. Either way it was fresh, hot, tasty and a great deal for the price. I wouldn't do a dinner date here or anything but for a casual nice lunch or dinner that's not the same fast food fare, I definitely recommend it.", "stars": 4, "cool": 1, "useful": 1, "date": "2015-03-27"}, {"user_id": "qnMR9YDAZuWP1ufBM_pKhg", "review_id": "KdFgqFLuuVi0UgYBjfYd5w", "funny": 0, "business_id": "hMgIF04rrJ7oB1lGIpFt5w", "text": "This is owned by the old original cook/owner of Tang Dynasty in Lincoln Square Mall.

All were quite flavorful and tasty, and not too oily (something that happens often in this town with Chinese food, sadly). Could not stop eating the green beans, even my four year old liked them. For those who use this metric for their Chinese restaurants: every other patron there was native Chinese, both students and older folk. Parking is free, easy and plentiful. \n\nAs others have said, the interior is the exact same (they even still have the beanbag toss game out on the patio and the 'lucky' rock in the lobby from when it was Rock's) just with a bunch of tables thrown in but I'm sure that'll change as it gets established.\nThe serving staff was efficient (might have to point at the menu item you're ordering) and quick with the food, which was piping hot and obviously freshly made, and quite friendly with my son when he practiced his Chinese on them. \n\nAll in all a nice time, excellent authentic food, easy parking close to campus and convenient hours.

Cheaper than other Indian places in the area but due to the small location size less variety of food as well (half the buffet table is salad bar/dessert/sauces), so it evens out. Nice touch: they weigh the buffet takeout, so you don't have to pay the full price if you don't load up.\n\nNaan: just ok, but I did get takeout so it might've suffered a bit in transit. Naan is best fresh and hot.\n\nveggie korma: very good, nicely spicy, good flavor, vegetables were good quality.\n\npekora: nicely crunchy even after sitting in a styrofoam box for a few minutes, little salty.\n\npalak chana: good, nicely spicy and flavorful, right thickness of sauce\n\nkidney bean chickpea thing I forget the name of: kind of bland, I usually expect more fire in this dish.\n\ntandoori chicken: not great, surprisingly. It was dry and surprisingly hot (spice wise) while being less flavorful than I'm used to. Maybe it'd just been sitting around for awhile (its hard to make dark meat dry!)\n\nlemon rice: yellow rice with fried peanuts in it. I liked the peanuts, gave it a nice crunch, but didn't really taste anything else flavor wise; could've just been plain old basmati rice.\n\nchicken curry: ok, this is why this place dropped a full star. The chicken curry is bone in, which would be fine if it were whole bone, but the bone is cleaver-chopped, which leaves tiny shards of barely-detectable bone EVERYWHERE. Seriously I was picking through this thing like I was dissecting in a lab to make sure I didn't kill myself with every bite. I don't even remember how it tasted. I realize this is 'authentic' but so is using a cow-dung oven to make naan and I'm betting they don't do that. Debone your chicken curry, you're gonna get sued.\n\nThe interior decor is really quite nice (a huge change from when it was Wonderdogs, you won't recognize the place), the music wasn't too loud, there was a refreshing lack of tv blaring in the corner, the proprietors are very nice and conscientious, and things were moving along well in such a tight space (you're not going to like it at lunch rush if you're claustrophobic/have a phobia of strange people bumping up against/brushing by you). The vegetarian dishes are better than the meat dishes, and I didn't try everything available on the lunch buffet (two or three more items, a lentil soup, desserts (mango custard sounds really good but I didn't want to mingle flavors).\n\nFeels like the vegetarian dishes were better than the meat-based ones, and there is plenty of vegetarian on offer. Wish they'd add samosas to the buffet. Overall I'd recommend it if you want Indian buffet but don't want/don't have time to leave campus, just avoid the chicken curry, especially if you're feeding kids or something.", "stars": 3, "cool": 0, "useful": 2, "date": "2013-11-14"}, {"user_id": "qnMR9YDAZuWP1ufBM_pKhg", "review_id": "kxnvf4xuW5HwYJGkyUFPXw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "D-B5LsTHJgrhsHVex4gyHA", "text": "Layalina has closed; a Chinese restaurant called Schezwan Chinese is going in there now.

The chef salad is quite decent but they put these onions on it that look like they were meant to be battered and deep fried for onion rings. They were so large and overpowering that I started requesting to leave them off of the salad. Overall, the food has been decent, but this last time, I decided to get a small order of chili cheese fries. My God, that was a mistake. The chili was obviously out of a can...easily mistaken for dog food (even the smell took me for a loop). The cheese was like cheez-wiz....not appetizing at all.

It was good, but very rich and not even close to as good as the beef cheek ravioli from Carnevino. I am not sure why people would compare the two.

She informed me that they did not have my size in that particular boot in stock, but that I could check back in September.

I told her, I was aware of that, but if I was in the store, I'd still like to try a pair on to see if I even like the brand, especially if I was to wait until September for the ones I want.

Paired with helpful staff in costume and character helping you to your seats, and a breathtaking stage to take in sets your heart pumping for a great show. The opening scenes don't disappoint. The martial arts in the first couple scenes are amazing to watch, and soon you are treated to a boat scene that is also fun to watch. \n\nSecond star is for great acrobatics with the \"death wheel\" (you'll know it when you see it), and some more cool action sequences to close out the show. \n\nThird star is for the stage, which is a character all to itself. A massive monolithic stage that is on some sort of hydraulic mechanism that allows it to move, rotate, and lean in amazing angles further shows off the athleticism and skill of the actors as they use the stage to show a variety of talents. The stage can also be lowered completely out of site allowing for cool aerial acrobatics as well. \n\nNow for the last two stars that this show lacks. First off, you better listen carefully to the few lines of narration at the beginning of the show because that's all you'll get. While it does give the outline of the plot I still found it extremely difficult to follow the story line, and in fact there were several scenes that seemed ponderously slow and even repetitive without advancing the story in meaningful ways.  You never really understand why the enemy attacks, but they attack again and again, and normally in the same repetitive fashion. There are also two scenes, the beach and the shadow puppets, that are awkward and feel completely out of place. \n\nSecond, with the exception of the first 10-15 mins and 5-10 mins towards the end, the show's acrobatics seemed to be just \"OK\". There were \"wows\" and \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" in each section there, but often there were only a few and sometimes featured too early in a scene and repeated then without the same wow factor. With such an impressive stage and hints in the pre show antics of ways to use the stage and even the space above the audience in amazing fashion, the show itself left me with the sense that there was so much more that could've been. \n\nAll in all I was entertained but I can't say I enjoyed it, especially in comparison to other Cirque du Soleil shows and expectations. It's worth seeing for the stage if you can get a good price, but be prepared to feel like you over invested 90 mins of time. In another city and without the CDS mystique it would probably be amazing and awe inspiring, but in a Las Vegas world where \"Too Much\" is often \"Just enough\", I felt like Ka was just a little lacking.", "stars": 3, "cool": 1, "useful": 3, "date": "2016-07-10"}, {"user_id": "Cpn-ith-K5pZdWWfF4fTbA", "review_id": "OIGb8dVpZ2gufauWetP_WA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "D9Y1JQtSbattMvqfGnneow", "text": "Great place to get your phone fixed!!

They were happy to do it and did not charge anything extra for it unlike many other sushi places that will add an extra charge. Once again we really appreciate the customer service. \n     Another thing they have is a Sunday brunch all you can eat sushi offering. This is unusual in Arizona and love that they do it. Going out for sushi can often add up quick no matter were you go and for what a few rolls might cost you could do all you can eat at Kawaii during Sunday brunch.

First fyi: the company charges 80 dollars an hour (for two movers).  There is a minimum 2 hour block to use the services.

All I really needed moved was a dining table, desk, bed, dresser, small file cabinet, and nightstand.  Shouldn't take more than 2 hours, right?  Wrong.  The workers moved slower than tar and continually used my bathroom and drank all my bottled water.  4 hours later, I just asked them to stop and said that I would pay what I owed.  Over 500 dollars later, I was still left with a ton of stuff to move on my own.  Also, they taped shut my dresser drawers and file cabinet doors with a tape they assured me would not damage the paint.  And when I started peeling the tape away, half of the paint came off with it.  They do not take of belongings and they scratched up the entire surface of my 1 month old white desk to the point I had to paint the entire thing over in a dark color.\n\nIf you're in need of trustworthy movers, try to use bekins or another more well established company.

It's my favourite in Toronto along with Big Fat's Pulled Pork Burrito. I'm curious about BFB's breakfast one! I'm so addicted to the halibut though, that I can't seen to order anything else from BBz. I am in such a late night burrito mood tonight!\n\n \n\nI had to award both Burrito Boyz and Big Fat Burrito #1 to be fair. When I am craving a fish burrito, I go to BB. When I want something meaty, I go to BFB. It's as simple as that.\n\n1a. Burrito Boyz\nHalibut Burrito ($8.85 small, $9.73 large\n)Halibut Burrito - so much sauce, so much win!\nThe tortilla is toasted on a flat-top grill and the large gives you 1.5 lb of fish! Add a very generous helping of sauces: Lime-Chili Burrito sauce, sour cream, and hot sauce. Most of my friends get little to no hot sauce, but I like asking for two lines. Yum.\nI almost wrote this place off after trying their steak burrito - the beef was tough and unappetizing, despite the plethora of fillings. I'm really glad that I gave the place another go and tried their halibut burrito! I can ever resist its call...while curious about their veggie soy and shrimp burritos, I haven't been able to say no to halibut.\n1b. Big Fat Burrito\nPulled Pork\nI lo-o-o-ve their pulled pork burrito! It's always saucy, soft, and so good with guacamole. I always manage to stuff myself with a large without a single regret! You can get some yam in it too!\n\n3. Burrito Bandidos\nSteak Burrito\nThis is third because I only tried their steak - I bet their fish is just as good as Burrito Boyz. If I was ranking this on the steak alone, it'd be lower but I ought to be fair since the owners used to work together at Burrito Boyz so they're virtually identical.\n\n4. Z-teca\nBeef Barbacoa Burrito\nTried the one at Fairview Mall - this a popular chain. Pretty good if you're in the area and want a burrito fix! They're also often featured on Group Buy sites, so keep your eyes open for deals.\n\n5. Chipotle Mexican Grill\nCarnitas\nOwned by McDonalds, this has been a major hit-or-miss for me. The last time I went, the person who made my burrito jammed it full of Carnitas and I was very pleased. The time before that, the server was quite grumpy and I got a small handful of chicken. Nonetheless, when I needed a quick burrito fix around Yonge & Dundas, Chipotle did the trick...until Big Fat Burrito moved in. I rather like their Cilantro-Lime flavoured rice\n\n6. Burro Burrito\nSteak ($7.99 Large)\nLocated beside my beloved Fish Store, I popped by after a game of floor hockey. This was in my early burrito-blitzing days and I think that I've since realized that steak burritos are not the way to go unless if you're ordering them from a good restaurant like my visit to Sweet Smoke's BBQ\n\n7. Burrito Loco\nChicken Burrito\nSo close to being finished before the picture was taken! Oops!\n\nOf course, there's also Sweet Smoke's Flat Iron Steak burrito but since it's at a restaurant it's in a totally different class on it's own.\nSteak Burrito win @ $9, but not quick eats on the streets of Toronto\n\nHonourable Mentions - Not true Burritos but I still love 'em:\n1. The Fish Store\nTried almost everything - best: Black Cod Burrito with Avocado\nHonestly, if this was open later and closer to my place I'd get this over Burrito Boyz any day. The Fish Store is fantastic - they offer a huge selection of seafood that you can in sandwich or a wrap (which they call a burrito). Love Love Love.\n\n2. NY Subway\nPotato burrito, cauliflower burrito, lamb burrito\nThese aren't traditional burritos either - however their potato & cauliflower burritos are great! Totally recommend getting one of these over their meaty options.", "stars": 4, "cool": 1, "useful": 2, "date": "2010-09-16"}, {"user_id": "WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA", "review_id": "7WNFDEMY0_hFO_EWROecJg", "funny": 1, "business_id": "pZ1quwXnYozLIZIVABojhw", "text": "Visit #1\nCharcuterie Platter ($16 small/$25 large) & Thuet Bread ($2 small/$4 large\n)This is a wonderful introduction for those who have never tried charcuterie. Basically, charcuterie is a series of meaty products (cured, whipped & other preparation techniques) served on a wooden platter.\nAll offered with a pile of full-seeded mustard, a dish of teeny-tiny pickled vegetables, and we ordered Thuet Bread on the side. The Thuet bread was soft & fresh - a great accompaniment.\nThe star was the foie gras mousse - whipped to perfection, it just melts in your mouth.\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow ($9)\nHollowed with a little spoon & sprinkled with a bit of coarse salt on top of warm, smoky bread, this was tasty and good for the immune system. I reminded myself of the health benefits as I savoured each bit of fatty, rich, comforting flavour.\n\nTongue in Brioche ($13)\nThe sandwich was a ridiculously generous portion of thinly sliced beef tongue between two plump slices of fragrant brioche, all held together with a skewered cornichons. A healthy (hah!) dose of mustard and tarragon mayo drizzled all over made my heart skip - whether it was in fear or excitement, I'm still not sure.\nIncredibly soft and tender, prior to this delight I didn't know that tongue could be this delectable. While I prefer the buttery & decadent Tongue Grilled Cheese at Hoof Cafe, I would never turn down this sandwich.\n\nRaw Horse Sammy w/ Hot Sauce ($22)\nFresh bread topped with horse tartar with a raw egg yolk & shallots on one slice, and a liberal helping of hot sauce on the other. The \"HORSE\" spelled out in sauce was a fun touch. I couldn't believe how tasty the raw horse meat was - I tried it with and without the hot sauce & bread to get a sense of the true flavour.\n\nVisit #2\nCrispy Pig Ear Salad\nStrips of breaded & deep-fried pig ears over radishes, carrots, edible flowers with a lime buttermilk dressing\nI liked the pig ears, but I found the dressing too buttery and generous on the salad. As someone who prefers light, acidic dressing (or none at all with the right greens!) it was unappetizing. However, I was at the Black Hoof so this was to be expected.\nThe pig ears were crispy as advertised, and full of fatty-flavour with each bite. A dining companion claims that Buca does a better version...\n\nFluke Crudo\nFluke along with charred fava beans, avocado cream, sliced chili, pancetta, herbs & cilantro dressing.\nI really liked the avocado cream and fava beans. A little heavy on the dressing (but again, it's Hoof!) but the combination of the sliced chili & cilantro was delightful with the fish. Love the plating :)\n\nN'Duja & Corn Tagliatelle\nHouse tagliatelle noodles with charred corn, charred cherry tomatoes, and the n'duja which is a spicy calabrese salami melted into the pan. Garnished with a green onion salad on top.\nMmm. I realy enjoyed this - house pasta was al dente and the creamy sauce blended very well with the charred corn and tomatoes. I still have trouble pronouncing it, but the n'duja was quite tasty with a bit of heat and I would happily order this dish again. Creamy, spicy, & corny goodness. I love sweet corn!\n\nPork Belly, Squid,& Melon\nBaby squid, Berkshire pork belly & chunks of melon in a watermelon glaze with turmeric, cumin. Flaxseed, Vietnamese cilantro, mint, & basil also riddle this succulent dish.\nWhile the pork belly and the squid were both well done and delicious, the pairing did not do much for each other. They were enjoyed separately with the watermelon glaze. I must have gotten a good chunk of watermelon, as a dining partner-in-crime said she didn't taste the melon but I certainly did. As usual, the pork belly made me pause to fully enjoy the flavour. So decadent and perfectly pan-cooked.\n\nCalf's Brain Ravioli\nHouse ravioli in sage, brown sugar, & butter sauce with Parmesan shavings\nSo...It was an oily mess, and I was very glum as a result. From the poor presentation, meagre calf brain filling, blah pasta, and too-sharp cheese I reluctantly ate all 5 raviolis wondering why I was even bothering with each bite. It was cooked al dente, just like the tasty tagliatelle, but I don't think that that is the best way to cook ravioli. Sigh. A fellow diner sampled a bit of my dish and agreed that it was simply not good. Darn it. But that's 1 bad dish out of so many amazing ones...so all is forgiven =)\n\nPics: http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/2010/08/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.html\nPics: http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/2010/09/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.html", "stars": 4, "cool": 1, "useful": 2, "date": "2010-09-11"}, {"user_id": "OcG7IyWe2q4fv1UbCwIzbw", "review_id": "y4FB25U3pjTrGIVgpsQX0w", "funny": 0, "business_id": "VbEK6-etnKKaPamrG2jWjQ", "text": "Way overpriced and overrated.

Tim Brown, son in law of the owner, was assigned to us.   Tim came out to look at the property and we gave him the plans for the pool that was installed as well as the Plot plan for the house.   We discussed what we wanted with Tim and left to draw an initial plan.   Days later Tim emailed a basic plan and a video of his ideas, So far So Good.   In the meantime we contacted a couple of much larger pool companies, including one that we had used before and has a very good reputation.   Its a good thing we did as the other companies check the codes and found setbacks restrictions that Tim was unaware of.   Due to the research of the other pool companies, we had Tim redraw the plan with those setbacks in mind, as well as some other ideas.   This happened on a number of plan iterations, where another pool company would have a great idea and we would share that idea with Tim to incorporate into our plan.   There were many differences in design quality such as AZ Rainfall uses Alumawood for their Ramadas as opposed to building from scratch like all other builders.   We informed Tim that we would have to check with our association as their rules required similar building materials as the original residence.   All of the sudden I get a call from Tim Brown saying they didn't have the time to send a final plan for approval by the HOA, without which we could not get approval.\nIt appears that this well over $100,000.00 job was no longer of interest to AZR.   I guess that the demand for pools and landscaping is strong enough that some builders that are not big enough to perform certain jobs find it easier at the last minute to withdraw, having wasted valuable client time.

A little unusual, but no big deal so far. A waitress came in a reasonable amount of time and took our drink orders. My ice tea was horrid. It definitely did not taste freshly brewed and had an artificial lemon flavor to it. She took our orders, and brought the children's (burnt) food quickly. Then about 15 minutes later, came back and said they were out of what I had ordered. I found something else to order, and someone eventually brought it along with our other adult meal. Our food was cold when we got it, and of course the kids were done eating by then.  We then didn't see our waitress for about 45 minutes, long after we had finished eating our cold food and were trying to entertain our children who were understandably getting restless at that point.  We were finally able to flag her down and get our bill. I never once saw any sign of management anywhere.

From the first class to over 500 classes it NEVER gets easy, you only get stronger and discover new ways to challenge yourself. Pure Barre targets your full body, all the areas that every girl wants to tone up. It's an hour spent working hard to amazing music with WONDERFUL teachers who motivate and inspire you to push yourself past your comfort zone. A nice bonus, ALL the clients that attend the classes are the nicest people which makes for a place you always look forward to coming back to. It's a great workout for anyone. Any age, fitness level, someone who has a lot of dance experience or absolutely none. I highly recommend Pure Barre to anyone looking for a way to tone your body, build strength, all while making lifetime friends. \n\nTip: Commit to at least a month at Pure Barre (try 4 classes a week) because it just gets better and better the more you learn the technique :)", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2015-06-06"}, {"user_id": "pTGVqTpsPffvwII5EsGvaw", "review_id": "AFSI_dqTTebrAYczbePSYQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "CrDHpkNGyHUgLAMynKfBZA", "text": "Honestly, this has got to be one of the BEST things offered in Pittsburgh!

The final mixup was on the day of closing when they included impounds in my final payment when a i had clearly requested and  signed documents saying I did not.

When I met Annie, the experience was ENTIRELY different!!! The first thing she asked me was what I envisioned for my hair color, what I did not like about it, and how I thought it would be perfect. Another thing she said was that anytime I was bored with my hair to feel free to tell her and she would revolutionize it again. She stayed true to her promise in the now two years that I have been seeing her. I also LOVE that if I want something new done to my hair and it is not fashion forward, she will work with the idea until it is. It always comes out even better than the original thought!!! I keep telling her that she needs to start her own product line too so hopefully that is to come soon!!! :D\n\nAs far as the vintage portion...Miles runs that. It always has intriguing items that are not what you would expect to find just anywhere. I have personally not made a purchase yet, but my colleague and I went to 3rd Thursday and she bought a door for $5!!! There is not even where to have lunch for that price!

No complexity of flavor in any of the beers, although I haven't tried the stout. They aren't bad, they just have nothing to stand out.\nBut the reason I decided to write this review is that I was tremendously disappointed during my last visit in early Feb.  Since I work nearby my visits have often included lunch or happy hour food, and I thought they had a decent selection of affordable options. But they removed some of my go-to vegetarian items from the menu.  When I expressed my disappointment, the bartender told me they took the veggie items off because they weren't selling as much.  I can see why a restaurant might stop advertising a item that is not selling.  But there are few replacement options when you start removing vegetarian choices.  In addition, when I asked if they still made the veggie wrap at all, the bartender simply said no.   I hate the thought of being high maintenance, so I didn't press the issue. But I imagine that it wouldn't have been that difficult to do.\nSince the waitstaff was not interested in my satisfaction, and since the other food I have tried (bar food, typical salad) is just average and I prefer other beer, I won't be back.", "stars": 2, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2012-02-24"}, {"user_id": "cWqUl_hLE6xFAhSD03gUIg", "review_id": "JG6Tin5qHf8U6Fd1vWvShg", "funny": 0, "business_id": "PAXUkXtz3YbzNZYlSTuMhA", "text": "Every time I have tried calling them, there's always a problem.

They told me to drive it home and bring it back the next day. This happened three times that week. I thought they had fixed it by the third time as they said they did but this was not true.  I had to bring about the following week another two additional times. What a nightmare!\n\nService staff here are incredibly rude, unprofessional and they really don't care about customer service whatsoever.  The only person that was actually nice was the receptionist. \n\nI thought perhaps this was isolated to the service department but it turns out that this is not the case. I came back for a part a few months later and the parts counter staff were just as rude and confrontational. I simply wanted to purchase a part! I didn't need the attitude.\n\nI have decided that my next car won't be a BMW - I'm going with another luxury car retailer.

I was impressed and excited to get on with my meal.  I ordered from the Things in Bowls section of the menu, and opted for the Smoke in a Bowl.  The meal was good, I would have it again, filled me up, plenty of chicken, plenty of vegetables, nice flavor.  It was good, nothing to write home about, but good.

It was very dark where I was sitting in the restaurant so maybe I just couldn't see it.\n\nThe customer service left a lot to be desired.  It's all about training your employees, some owners/ managers take it seriously, others don't.  The person that took my order was great, friendly, helpful, nice smile.

I assume SkinnyFATS has been burned repeatedly by their customers using debit/ credit cards that don't belong to them, hence they card you, doesn't say much about their clientele overall.

Very common courtesy dictates, especially in a retail/ business type of establishment that when offered a Hello or a Thank You by a customer, a simple reply is good business.  I assumed the person that delivered my food was having a bad day at work.  As I was enjoying my Smoke in a Bowl one of the staff was busy clearing and cleaning the table next to me.  As this person started to vigorously sweep the floor beneath and around the table next to me, I lost my appetite.  Sweeping the floor stirs up dust and whatever else is on the floor.  In my head I was imagining all sorts of debris floating around in the air and landing on my table and on top of my Smoke in a Bowl and in my off-brand Coke.

I didn't get the room service guy's name because I was too busy staring at - seriously - LESIONS on his face, neck, and even wrist!  It wasn't acne, it was some kind of exczema or something.  I've never not eaten nachos before in my life, that night was a total waste of food and money.  Why hire room service guys who destroy your appetite!?  Isn't that a health code violation too?\n Finally, I was looking forward to talking to the front desk as I checked out.  The clerk asked the people in front of me \"did you enjoy your stay with us?\" so I figured that would be my opportunity to let Mandalay Bay know that it was really not an accomodating place to stay.  However, the front desk clerk just checked me out without even talking and moved right on to the next in line with cold dead eyes.  I should have stayed and asked for a manager but I was honestly too tired and frustrated to fight.  \n \"Disappointed\" cannot even begin to describe our stay at Mandalay Bay.  I had hoped to take my birthday party there this summer for their awesome pools but there's no way I'm going to put up with their incompetent, scuzzy staff, poor reservation schedule, and counterproductive accomodations.

I work in the restaurant industry so it usually takes a lot of wrongs for me to think service sucks. Upon arrival not more than 10 tables in the entire restaurant and got sat promptly.

He took our drink order and she finally rolled up right before he delivered the drinks. We were ready to order so she took our order and for as slow as it was it took 26 minutes for our food to come out. She asked if we needed anything and we said no, but after a few bites into our meal we noticed my son didn't have all the condiments that came with his fajita dish so we waited a bit, then looked around and saw one server tending to her tables and our server nowhere to be found. I asked the other server in passing if she could get our server but instead she offered to get the missing condiments. As always server came by just a little to late. After finishing our meal I was looking around at an even slower restaurant with fewer tables and our server nowhere to be found again. Went up to the cashier, paid the bill and of course as we were leaving here came the server always a minute behind. Not sure if she was doing side work, eating, taking a break or just hiding but it's sad that every time I looked around the restaurant she was almost nowhere to be seen.

I think 2.5 would be a fair and accurate rating to give but 2 is my only option here. \nYelp considers 2 to be \"Meh. I've experience better\" what a great way to sum this place up.\n\nOur first two negative experiences happened at check in, the receptionist were nice, some of them were hard to understand but I don't think it was any fault of there's, more age related. Anyways we got our key card and proceeded upstairs to our non-smoking room. I swear, i've walked into some rooms that might have a \"faint\" smell of cigarettes, but this 1st room was as if someone took cartons of cigarettes, put them in the middle of the room and little them all on fire before throwing them out the window just as we walked in. We both were sick with colds so could not stand the stench. We walked downstairs again and politely told the front desk what happened. She apologized and said they were trying to fix this issue (it must happen a lot) but at least they are trying to fix it. Okay fine, second times a charm, we quickly are handed a new set of keys with a different room to test out.\nOur second room smells fine, and we quickly get excited, but it was short lived as we try to turn on the lights and soon realize that not a single light switch works, including the bathroom. At this point i'm viewing the hotel as a hike to and from the front desk and consider activating my step counter.\nOur 3rd visit to the desk we are polite again and explain what happened in this room, the women now seems amazed (maybe most people give up by the 3rd try?). So she quickly walks away and mumbles something about manager, she is being nice, i honestly cannot understand what she says though. I look at my female friend for a translation and she shrugs and mumbles manager in recognition of all i understood. \nOkay so the manager comes out and starts typing a novel on the keyboard and apologizing, he is also very nice and courteous, he helped us with 1 night resort fee which we definitely appreciated and moved us into our 3rd and hopefully final room.\nUpon entering our 3rd room everything is in order, smells, electricity, running water... so i'm happy camper, my female friend collapses into the bed in exhaustion from our hike in zion park and now in Circus Circus. \nDay 1 complete at Circus Circus... why is the clown so scary looking?\n\nDay 2\nGoes fine, the building doesn't explode but watch out for the toilets, they flush so hard i swear they could suck your arm down with it. Okay not really, but they will surprise you if you're not ready for it.\nSo it's 10pm, (12/17) I tell my friend we should watch a movie, she shrugs without thought while staring at an ipad. I think she knows i'm tempting fate at this point.. \nI click the menu and it tells me to call the front desk for movies. Okay...that's a little outdated but sure. I pickup the phone and make the call, front desk doesn't answer, instead it is the operator, who tries to connect me again... no luck, so she tells me they will call me back in a minute.

The place was packed, and I soon realized that this was not only attributed to its convenient location.  Earl's serves up some seriously good food.\n I'll be totally honest right out of the gate and say that I rarely frequent chain restaurants.  If I do, it's because it's for a birthday or office party where the show of hands wins.  Chain restaurants don't usually sell me on coming back for more.  Earl's did.\n\nWe started with the Tuna Poke Nachos ($11.50).  Served on crispy wontons, and loaded with cubed raw tuna, cucumber, avocado and tomato, they looked like they would be a task to eat.  I envisioned myself taking a bite and (if the toppings made it as far as my mouth without falling off) having it crumble, leaving me with half of a naked nacho, or in this case, wonton.  They surprised me though by maintaining their structure (and toppings).  The spicy mango coulis they were drizzled in leant a nice kick with some crushed macadamia nuts paying tribute to the Hawaiian roots of the dish. I'm not normally a big fan of sushi, but in this case the texture of the tuna and avocado married nicely with the crispiness of the wontons.\n\nNext was the Gnocchi with Italian Rose Sauce ($10.50).  I love gnocchi, but it is associated with being too heavy and too filling often because, well, it usually is.  Not in this case.  Earl's handmade potato gnocchi was the perfect consistency throughout.  Consistent consistency if you will.  And true we shared it, but it was a generous portion and neither of us felt weighted down afterwards.  That wasn't the best part though.  The title of the dish doesn't do it justice.  This gnocchi isn't served in just any ordinary rose sauce... it's served in a rose sauce made of San Marzana tomatoes, burrata cheese and fresh basil.  This, my friends, is the Margharita pizza of gnocchi.  Enough said.\n\nBeing ambitious (see: gluttonous), we welcomed the Pulled Pork Sandwich ($13.50) and Potato & Leek Soup ($7) to our table.  I'll start with the soup...although in reality that wasn't the sequence of events.  The soup was creamy and filled with chunks of potato (skin still on...because that's where all the vitamins are!).  It was good, but let's face it, it didn't compare to the main event of this course.  Even halved, our plates were dwarfed.  This is one behemoth of a sandwich.  Piled with tender BBQ braised pork and coleslaw then dressed with a fiery chipotle mayo, this sandwich was a nice balance of spicy and sweet.  It was messy like it should be so keep the napkins close at hand.  I had almost reached my limit but I knew dessert was on the way, so I exercised some will power (says the girl on her third course) and left a few bites on my plate.  I would be lying if I said I wasn't sad to see it go.\n\nYou might think that by this point we were too full to even consider the possibility of dessert, and by daily caloric standards, we probably should have been.  But we laughed in the face of those standards and pushed onward...onward to Warm Gingerbread Cake ($8).  Rarely do I find myself at a loss for words, but this cake found me there.  It might have had something to do with the fact that my mouth was full of the aforementioned cake, but also because it was really, really good.  I could use a plethora of colourful adjectives to describe this cake (see: heavenly, divine, decadent) but it all feels so clich\u00e9, and none of them would do it justice anyway, so I'm sticking with good.  Damn good.  It was served warm (as promised), drizzled with salted caramel sauce and with sides of brown sugar apple slices and vanilla bean gelato.  Now on any given day, I'll take a cookie over a slice of cake, but not on this day (or any day going forward where I'm given the choice between a cookie and this particular cake).  It was impossibly moist and as we ate it we debated about what made it so.  We came to the conclusion that... well, we didn't really come to any conclusion, except that it was killer, and we would be back for more.  Whoever is slicing the cake at Earl's isn't stingy (bless their soul) but that was one plate that went back to the kitchen devoid of crumbs.\n\nNow Earl's isn't the place to go for a quiet date.  The people are loud (because there are a lot of them), and the music is loud (because it fights to be heard over the people), but the food is excellent and the service, equally so.  It's a hike from my house in High Park to the Financial District, but one I'm willing to make again.  Three words folks... warm, gingerbread, cake.

While that may have been true a few years ago, boy-oh-boy, the times are changing. Those of us living in the neighbourhood awhile have seen its dynamic (albeit slow) change, particularly when it comes to food; but in the Junction's ever-expanding food landscape, a few places are setting the stage. Enter the Junction Fromagerie.\n\nJunction Fromagerie is sitting non-coincidentally right next to Delight, a chocolate shop that's perhaps known in the neighbourhood more for their ice cream than their handmade chocolate. Both Delight and Junction Fromagerie are brain-childs of the same people, Jennifer Rashleigh & Jeff Brown, and the association is obvious as far as quality goes. While Delight doesn't have any cheese, they do have a uniquely flavoured and way-better-than-it-sounds Quebec blue cheese ice cream. Soft and creamy with an exacting amount of high-quality blue cheese, it's obviously well crafted and surprisingly tasty.\n\nWhat makes the Junction Fromagerie different from the handful of other cheese specialty shops in Toronto is their strict direction to Canadian products; they only carry Canadian cheeses, local and artisanal mind you, but Canadian nonetheless. They're also particularly partial to Ontario cheeses. Their in-house made butter, crackers, and croustinis, in conjunction with those small-batch and locally sourced cheeses, make them a worthy underdog in an increasingly competitive business.\n\nThe Junction Fromagerie brings with it some old-world charm, and at first walk-in, you may mistake it for a boutique fromage on a quiet Paris street. Big-frame bay window and a creaky wood-laid floor set the space. Besides that, the whole store is fairly nondescript other than the front case brightly displaying their cheeses.\n\nDon't know your Comtomme from your Bleu de la Moutonndere? No worries! Not only is the staff knowledgeable and the cheese labeled and explained, but the Junction Fromagerie also offers cheese tastings and pairings that not only teach you about the cheese they carry, but also inspire you to be a bit more adventurous in your cheese selections. Although these tastings aren't a regularly occurring event, they do happen. Their Stone's Throw Cheese and WIne Pairing event, which was created with the folks at Stone's Throw Winery, sold out super quick.\n\nThe appearance of Junction Fromagerie signals more than just beautiful cheese being available in the Junction. It also serves as an important reminder that when it comes to food, the Junction is fast becoming a neighbourhood that is known for quality.", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "useful": 4, "date": "2010-12-15"}, {"user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "review_id": "WF8IWKJOiZAepJRK4SA3cw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "oYWy-hOTCOF7h8DCAZ_Mxw", "text": "Cool Hand of a Girl offers simple and healthy food made with organic products, which has become what you'd expect from a place in the Junction as of late.

That's where Cool Hand loses points. Maybe it's all part of the appeal for the artsy crowd you can expect to see, but Cool Hand can make you feel as if you're an annoyance to them just for being there.

I guess they should. They tout themselves as being Toronto's first onsite roastery--since 1988. Despite all that time, it's not a colossal roasting operation. In fact, it's a small machine in the front window of the shop, but that's part of the appeal of this place: fair-trade coffee roasted onsite, in small batches, right in front of your eyes.\n\nAs it becomes available, Coffee Tree scrawls all of their different roasts and blends of contrasting kinds of beans on a chalkboard near the front entrance. Some of these blends and roasts change from time-to-time; others are Coffee Tree's signatures. On any given day, you can expect to find Casa Primi, Sensuous Morning, Tuscany, and Millionaire's Mixture; some of their well-known signatures. Other days, you can find blends that have been created exclusively for the week or month.\n\nRegardless of what you choose, this coffee is superb, roasted perfectly, and balanced. Sip it slowly, and you'll definitely find complexity. There's the perfect blend of sweet and savoury and none of the unpleasant bitterness you'd expect from other coffee shop brews.\n\nBut it ain't all coffee at Coffee Tree. They've got a surprisingly detailed food menu, considering it's a coffee joint. From breakfast, lunch, and dinner, to French toast, sandwiches, and empanadas, they've got something for whatever time of day you go. They've also got a chilled dessert fridge featuring in-house made desserts, which includes what they call--and I'm inclined to agree--the World's Best Carrot cake. If you're there, give it an unregrettable try.\n\nThe shop layout is the typical long narrow space of most Toronto street-level businesses, and unfortunately, their furniture and decorating ideas aren't much of a help. Despite having unforgettable coffee, the space makes the experience of drinking it feel closed off.  They do, however, support local art by featuring a local artist's work on their walls for sale, and that certainly is a plus, but when I was there, the art wasn't something I was particularly captivated by; but I'm told it changes. All this place really needs a little reno, and it would be near perfect, or at least get 5 stars in my review.\n\nDespite the poor decor choice, they still roast some brilliant coffee.

There are certain essential qualities that it must have: a friendly, knowledgeable staff, a charming host, great atmosphere and above all, fantastic food. Tab\u00fcl\u00e9 is unquestionably one of these restaurants. Serving amazing Middle Eastern cuisine, Tab\u00fcl\u00e9 is a midtown spot not to be missed.\n\nTab\u00fcl\u00e9 offers fresh, intensely flavoured dishes from start to finish. Over several visits, I have had the pleasure of trying about half the menu and have yet to come across a dish that wasn't utterly delectable. Normally not a big fan of eggplant, I make exceptions here for the babagan\u00fcj, a gorgeous pure\u00e9d eggplant dip mixed with tahini, garlic and lemon juice. Additionally, the fried eggplant has great char on it and is finished with a lemon & garlic dressing that adds a bright note to the soft, creamy, rich starter. Not to be overlooked are the fresh, pungent tab\u00fcl\u00e9 and the labni which is a yogurt cheese mixed with a healthy dose of garlic and topped with zaatar. Finally, the hot cauliflower appetizer was recommended by the host who did not steer us in the wrong direction. Finished with Lebanese tahini, there were polite fights over who would get the last morsel.\n\nOnce you have gorged yourself on the hot and cold mezze (starters), it is time to move on the main event. There is always a fresh fish of the day, topped with the bright house lemon and garlic dressing. The grilled mains all come with heaping portions of rice with crispy onions for texture as well as grilled peppers, onions and zucchini. The kefta is certainly a popular option and a tasty one at that. Consider them Lebanese meatballs, made with a mix of ground lamb and beef, tomatoes, onions, parsley, garlic and lemon juice. Always perfectly cooked, they are steaming hot upon arrival at the table, a little bit pink inside. Also fabulous is the charcoal-broiled shrimp that have been marinated in Middle Eastern spices. Spicy and succulent, they are even slightly better with the squeeze of lemon that accompanies this particular dish. You will not want to share them with your dining companions.\n\nWhile you are thoroughly enjoying your food, take some time to look around and drink in the atmosphere. The restaurant itself is cozy without feeling claustrophobic and the dining room is host to just about every demographic in Toronto. You will see couples on dates, families, birthday celebrations, even bachelorette parties. On Saturday night, people wait patiently at the bar for a table and are entertained by the belly dancing show at 9pm. Though a little calmer during lunch, Tab\u00fcl\u00e9 certainly does not lack atmosphere. Upon return visits, you will notice that you see the same wait staff over and over again - a good sign in a turbulent industry. Hospitality is the name of the game here, and it is done expertly.\n\nShould you have room for dessert (and if you don't, just loosen your belt a little. It's worth it), check out the k\u00fcnafa ashta. Lebanese custard is topped with super fine shreds of phyllo pastry, pistachios and rose water syrup. Light and not overly sweet, this dish is a superb way to end a meal and is a paradigm of why Tab\u00fcl\u00e9's menu is so successful: it combines many elements in a balanced, seamless dish. It is at once creamy, crunchy, a bit tart, a bit sweet and is highly aromatic.\n\nLike the final course of the evening, all the dishes at Tab\u00fcl\u00e9 balance flavor and texture and, because of this, the food is elevated beyond the ingredients.

A lot of love went into this place; and not only love for their little diner, but also love for the neighbourhood in which it sits.\n\nUpon entering, the greeting was warm and friendly, which wouldn't be strange as my guest and I have eaten there a couple of times, but you don't need to be a regular to feel at home; every one of their guests seems to be rewarded with a warm smile and happy hello.\n\nThe room is decorated with local art mixed with diner kitsch.

It also features a lot of Italian fare with both a panini and pasta section.\n\nOn a recent visit, my guest tried the 'Mac'n'Cheese', which she thought was cheesy and good, albeit needing a little more flavour. My Bloordale Brisket sandwich was sloppy and well cooked--as it should be! The brisket meat was tender, but not falling apart. The barbeque sauce was a little sweeter than I generally like, but overall the sandwich was filling and comforting just like diner food is supposed to be. Served with their expertly seasoned and perfectly crisp French fries and creamy coleslaw, it was quite a large portion.\n\nOpen for breakfast, lunch and dinner and with a menu that has vegetarian options and interesting daily specials, like meatloaf, 'Jalapeno Popper' burger or house cured trout, The Bloordale Pantry pretty much offers something for everyone.", "stars": 4, "cool": 1, "useful": 3, "date": "2011-02-21"}, {"user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "review_id": "thXhMCBeDU4Ht-o1EEPDdA", "funny": 2, "business_id": "ct90rEU1YlKgzW7BrfAZTw", "text": "Despite all of the new multi-story buildings going up in the area, the Entertainment district is still full of lively, exciting, cool and truly unique places to check out; from the theatres to the restaurants, it is a great area to spend a night or two and explore.  I hesitate to say I \"stumbled\" upon this particular location as it is quite visible across from the main strip of theatres on this part of King Street, but I did enter on quite the spontaneous whim.\n\nTheir contemporary and inviting atmosphere is infused with Motown and Blues d\u00e9cor and music, which sets the mood perfectly for their southern dishes.  They offer up a nicely balanced menu of traditional Cajun-style grub and the more typical Canadian restaurant fare; from fish and fried foods galore, to goat-cheese-adorned salads and honey-garlic chicken, there really is something for everyone.\n\nI popped in early and was greeted with the notice of half-priced appetizers before 8:00 p.m. - a great opportunity to try a couple.  There are plenty of barbecued chicken, rib and steak platters to choose from, but what could be more appropriate than their cornmeal crusted catfish sticks?  I had them with the goat cheese and Cajun-roasted pistachio salad, and it turned out to be a delightful meal.\n\nThe catfish sticks are a must. After I ordered, a small plate with one tiny morsel of something arrived in front of me - this was worrisome.  Thankfully, it was just a mini-muffin sized, mildly sweet portion of cornbread (a side note: not enough restaurants give you complimentary bread at the table anymore; it does not have to be an overflowing basket of buns, but just a small bite of something light and delicious starts the meal off right). When the fish did arrive, I was more than impressed with the serving size. They were light and crispy and with smokey-sweet Cajun spice and served a tangy tartar sauce.\n\nThe salad had a hint of that same Cajun spice on the pistachios, but was otherwise just as expected for greens, except for one crucial detail - the copious amount of cheese!  Finally, a restaurant after my own dairy-loving heart!  I have too often overpaid for goat-cheese-promising pastas and salads that have fallen short.  Joe Mamas, on the other hand, gave me a meal-size salad, with more than my fair share of cheese, and all at half-price no less!\n\nI eased myself into my first southern cuisine experience with a dinner of appetizers, worried that I might be confronted with an over-spiced and over-fried spread.  Thankfully proven wrong, on my next visit to Joe Mamas, I'll be diving into their menu with less hesitancy.", "stars": 4, "cool": 4, "useful": 3, "date": "2011-01-15"}, {"user_id": "LsN3fFDkKjUzUU8o7enE-A", "review_id": "ShHKkAHxdN5G5f79AFq7zQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "QDvUdj36I_oAzXoFzCQnNA", "text": "Prefer crusty breads at other Italian restaurants.

We had the owner come and look at our brand new home and give us an estimate of painting the inside of our home.  The price was reasonable and being that we found this company at the home show and because the company was licensed and bonded we hired them to do the job.  We were told the job would take 4 days and we checked on the progress every day.  Again this is our brand new never lived in home, on the last day of painting we checked on the progress only to find the painting was completed along with major damage to our brand new shower.  The owner did not call us when the damage occured and when we contacted him he fessed up and apologized that one of his workers had fallen off a ladder and broke an entire slab of stone in our shower and promised to take care of the damage.  When we asked why we were not told when it happened the owner said he was trying to come up with a solution first.  Seemed odd to us we werent told immediately but let it go.  We then had to get the original stone installers to our new home for an estimate and provided the estimate to the painter.  The owner of the company did send us a check for the difference of what we owed him and the damage to our stone which is still not yet fixed as it had to be ordered so we have been without a shower now for over two weeks.\n\nWe thought this would all be behind us and that it was just an unfortunate accident that wasnt handled very well.  That was until we found further damage to the outside of our home.  It was obvious more damage was done by the companies workers!  They had dragged a pallet of paint from our gate to our back door in our backyard.  The pallet was left in our backyard and we were able to trace the lines the pallet made all the way to its last ending point.  Based on the tracks it appears the workers pushed the pallet around the corner of our house and pulled so hard it removed the stucco and paint from the side of our BRAND NEW house.  \n\nI was never advised of this damage either and when we emailed the owner of the company we never received a response.  We are beyond dissatisfied with this company based on the damage they did to our home not once, but twice and how it was handled.  We have never written a review on a company before and have never been so dissatisfied and wanted to warn others of our experience with this company.  Our suggestion although the price may be reasonable choose another company for any painting needs BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY!", "stars": 1, "cool": 1, "useful": 3, "date": "2013-08-20"}, {"user_id": "sm532xNx-vSRO9CMcfqVZw", "review_id": "qrlPU5jb_IRftbMj3rmCUg", "funny": 0, "business_id": "IuOFGmsMOKUhkJNMvJewRQ", "text": "I just went to the Mesa location and was very pleased with the service.

The employees and owner all live up to the name and their mission. The owner came by to check out my situation the next day after I contacted Honest Pool Care. He was very eager to check it out, as he was concerned about the problem becoming worse if we waited too long. He was very thorough during his visit. He wasn't there for the full hour. Therefore, he had no interest in charging me for the full hour visit. He gladly reduced the price for me. Awesome! He could have very easily charged me full price as he was there for more than 30 minutes. He told me what he thinks might be the root of the issue but stressed he would talk it over with some repair techs to be sure and to avoid unnecessary costs and repairs. After discussing with his crew, he called me to inform me of their findings the following day. I love that this company is on top of things! Regretfully, I was a former Poolman customer. Dealing with that company is like pulling teeth. It takes a week just to talk about an issue with that awful company.  He was honest and told me what he had initially thought was the issue, no longer seems to be an issue at all. He explained to me what was going on and offered me options to fix this problem.  I appreciate that as well because he could have easily taken advantage and  only offer one solution...one where his company would profit. Experiencing this level of great customer service helps to ease my nervous attitude toward this situation. Also, I must note that I live in South Phoenix. I called multiple pool companies that claim they service Phoenix and surrounding areas. However, none of them were willing to come this far south. Honest Pool Care, according to this site, services Tempe and surrounding areas. This company is willing to come to this area. Also, they could use horrible business tactics and \"tax me\" in a way for the drive but, thankfully, they did not.

Right at the front they tell me i have to leave my stroller behind...are you kidding me... no restaurant has ever ask me to do that before...what if one of my kids was sleeping? i actually  try to time it that way so i can eat a meal in peace.\n\nSince we were all hungry i figured ok lets just stay in.I asked for a booth because it is easier to manage my 3 yr old in there.The waitress gave me a weird look and said that a booth is not available and we can  sit at a regular tabe...why...i do not know...the restaurant wasn't even that busy\n\n.ok so i am getting pretty irritaded by now...i insisted of getting that booth...she gave it to us but with an attitude. I figured it can not get any worst than this lets just enjoy our meal.\n\nAs i am getting the menu i ask for the high chair...the waitress tells me she can not give me the high chair because we are sitting in a booth...what?!..i always get a high chair sitting in a booth and it is never a problem and maybe if you didn't take my stroller away i would be able to put my younger child in there.\n\nAt this point i asked for a  manager. She tells me how it is dangerous for my son to sit there because it is blocking the waitress to serve the food to our table  and the food is hot...and they are concerned about safety...believe me there was more than enough space \n\n\nI was quite upset at this point so she brings me a high chair...the one that you are supposed to strap in to a chair...hello...i can not strap this to anything we are sitting in a booth...am i supposed to sit my 1 yr old child in a high chair that is not straped in into anything...i think that it is pretty dangerous!\n\nDon't ask why but we stayed anyway with me and my child sitting on my lap.\n\nBUT I TOLD MYSELF I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN ...EVER!\n\nIt is a waste of a good restaurant...poor management!\n\nI would highly recommend the Promenade location.

Chicken and ribs were very good.  Wife did not like the beans which were watery (but I thought tasty).  We were given plastic fork, knife & spoon which made eating difficult.  (Try slicing meat with a plastic knife.)  Corn was pretty bad.\n\nWe ended up going back there for 2 breakfasts (mid-week BTW) and had no trouble getting in.  My wife was very happy with hers.   I had omelets both times and 1st was good and 2nd was passable.  Good toast (no small thing) and breakfast potatoes.\n\nWe did play slots there quite a bit.  My wife ended up breaking even (including losses at the big casinos) and I didn't lose too much with several hours of play.\n\nEllis is a 1 (Vegas) block walk from Bally's by a less than delightful fenced off, abandoned parking lot.  A couple of street people (junkies?) seem to sit out by the 7-11, but no trouble.  My wife was glad I was with her.\n\nNot really busy while we were there so smoke was not a problem, but it's one thing I hate about casinos.  I wonder why non-smokers have so few (or no) options?

My boyfriend got a large poutine, which was basically enough to feed a family of four. And he topped his with gravy, sauteed onions, mushrooms and chicken. We were unable to finish his so we packed it up and enjoyed the rest later that night. And it was delicious! I should also note that the service at this location was impeccable, my boyfriend forgot to check off which gravy he wanted, he left that box blank, so when they brought us our dishes they also brought a soup bowl full of gravy for him, just in case, without us even asking.

The place was very packed as it's apparently the popular place during spring training. Hubby ordered steak. It seemed like a blackened piece of char but he tried it. He said it was hard to describe, but the absolute worst steak he's ever had. This place needs a new chef or something. The steak doesn't come with a baked potato, but it came with cut up carrots and corn on the cob. The carrots didn't look appetizing and I didn't see anyone who had finished them- what a waste. He ordered the baked potato at a charge but he shared it with me. They give you a huge salad that's drenched in a dressing- Italian maybe. Service was ok- our guy was nice. What I was very irritated by was the staff yelling Excuse Me! every time they needed to get by you. We were a group of 8 trying to make it to a point where we could grab a nice pic of the couple, and so as a group were trying to make our way thru this crowded place. I found it rude the way the girls usually would yell from behind us, Excuse me as they tried to get by. Of course, we moved aside after being yelled at. That is just poor taste from a service stand point. I don't get why this place could be so crowded, except for the view. It's overpriced and low quality.

Obviously, I wasn't going to pay that much for a small problem, so I called another company called ANTA plumbing.

I ate the patty first and was blown away by the flavor,  I had to look around to make sure I wasn't somewhere in Brooklyn. I can only imagine if they have a Labor Day parade party in there, it would be a success because their food is already authentic and flavorful. This was my first visit there and not my last. I will make sure to stop by again maybe on Saturday to get some more patties. This patty had my eyes closed and toes curled and when that happens, to me that's a good sign. Not at all disappointed and the employees there were very approachable and nice. I had my food to go and splurge at home, I ate my patty before exiting Ocean Blue and got so excited, wish they had more patties. Again, I was blown away.

The chicken inside was moist and tasty. It comes with two dipping sauces. I tried the teriyaki and the honey mustard. Both were very good. Along with the strips I had the vegetable skewers, which also were really tasty. The meal came with a small piece of garlic toast and a drink.\n\nMy second time in I had the baked chicken strips which were moist and tender, and because I liked the veggie skewers so much the first time I got them again. Once again they came with Texas toast and a drink. All this for under 6 bucks.\n\nDuring the first visit my friend asked me how these chicken strips compared to Cane's. It had been a long time since I'd been to Cane's, so today I went there to compare. Cane's was decent, but nowhere close to as good as the chicken strips here at BFG.\n\nThe service, as has been mentioned already here many times, was excellent.

We were just there for the booze, plain and simple. The ambiance is very cool. Industrial chic - lots of concrete, glass, reclaimed wood and Edison bulbs. Lighting is dim, giving it a an intimate feel. If it was not SO crazy busy, it would be a really cool place to go on a date. I would say that they could benefit from some sound dampening. Maybe a rug or textile somewhere, because it can get awfully loud in there! I asked our mixologist for a whiskey sour (note - they're not bartenders. These people work magic with cocktail shakers and unique ingredients, they almost look like mad scientists or apothecaries with the amount of tiny glass bottles they work with) and it was absolutely the BEST whiskey sour I have ever had.

Despite my best intentions, I have just enough self-control to maintain an unsightly fast-food indebted belly, so I come here often. Much too often. I'm not sure if Misty (who is a lovely and sweet lady) finds it odd that I've recited my order to her enough times that I know her better than most of my immediate family, but if she does find it odd (and I know I do) she's excellent at pretending otherwise. If I ever come in and she asks me if I want \"the regular\" I'll know it's a sign I should cut back. But instead I'll probably just order something different. Maybe I'll add jalapenos to my burger, I don't know. I hope it doesn't get to that point. \n\nThe menu at Whataburger is pretty great - it has every option you'd expect from a burger joint and an \"all-time favorites\" menu that has some specialty burgers which are all fantastic, and though their burgers are always higher-priced than some of the other places you can go, they're big burgers. Everything I've tried on the menu has been fantastic, but it doesn't really matter, because I always order one of two things. To start, I always order a patty melt. Two patties, melted cheese, grilled onions and a sauce that I'd go into detail about if I wasn't concerned about alienating readers from displaying an alarming amount of affection for it. The patty melt is big and filling, but me being the careless fat man that I am I usually order a meal of chicken strips on top of it and make it a large. The meal comes with 3 strips, fries, a drink, a slice of texas toast cut diagonally (and we all know bread tastes better when cut that way), and your choice of dipping sauce. I always get gravy because it's perfect for dipping the bread into. Thank god they have diet Dr Pepper in the fountain so that I can keep this meal healthy and low-calorie. I always get spicy ketchup with my order instead of regular. I'm not sure I think it's better - in fact I'm pretty sure it's not, but sometimes the novelty wins out.\n\nSometimes, when I'm feeling adventurous, I make the patty melt the meal and get 2 honey butter chicken biscuit breakfast sandwiches instead of the chicken strips meal. That's where I find the only limitation with this place - they only serve breakfast between 11 PM and 11 AM. Fortunately I'm a goon and often don't wake up until the sun has gone down, which makes that time period take up a good portion of my day. On the other hand, what should be \"morning\" for me is often long past 11 AM. Oh and there was one other time when the guy working the drive-thru made me pull around front because it was going to take them a little longer to cook up all the food for the massive one-man feast I ordered, and he assured me he would throw in 2 apple pies for making me wait but instead he only gave me 1. I'll hold a grudge over that unforgivable crime until the day I die.\n\nBut this whataburger is open 24 hours. Even the inside is open all the time, and that's good because there aren't many other places where I can pig out at 4 AM except Filiberto's which always carries a much stronger \"you might get murdered here\" vibe at that hour, and I like to feel warm and safe while I destroy my body. I've spent enough money here to put one of my future children through college, and sometimes my individual orders are big enough that they cost more than anything you could get at a 5-star restaurant.

They wouldn't even make the appointment and that is what upset me!\nDear Margaret,\nI have spoken to the three women who interacted with you last Friday morning and on Sunday evening. To a person they describe your behavior as rude and belligerent. The packet you were mailed last October was quite explicit in stating that you are required to submit a copy of your child's birth certificate in order to have your daughter baptized. This is in accord with diocesan policy, and is in place for a variety of reasons. We do not deviate from this policy.\nIn that you appeared in the office on Friday morning, it is obviously not out of the question for you to also stop by your safety deposit box to retrieve the certificate. As Judy told you on the phone, we are quite flexible in arranging for baptism appointments that meet the needs of the parents, and will be happy to do so with you. Having all the requested information in hand at the time of your appointment ensures that everything is in order for your child's baptism. Our goal is to serve the needs of our parishioners as best we can, but we also rightly expect some cooperation from them as well. We will be happy to work with you and your husband to arrange for the baptism of your daughter and will set up an appointment at your convenience once you submit her birth certificate. I do not believe this is too much to ask.\nI am copying this email to Fr. Diskin at the diocese.\nRev.

Even things that shouldn't be high in fat. \n\nExample, the Grilled Vegetable Salad has 52 grams of fat. The Veggie Burger, 41 grams of fat.  Just a Beef Gyro has 55 grams of fat, 22 of which are saturated fat.

I'm handed a bowl and sent on my way, but I realize, when do I pay for this?  I go back, and the person, who I think is also a server, says I can pay for it here. O.K. I hand him the money, but there is no cash register, so he gets my change out of someone's tip, and it looks like he is baffled as to where to put my money. In any case I notice it costs a dollar extra for take-out. Maybe card board boxes are expensive.  Or maybe its a pseudo-tip for the server, because with take-out he wouldn't have gotten a tip else-wise.     In any case, VERY strange. I've never paid higher takeout prices before.  \n\nSo I fill my bowl and wait for my to-go order.  I can sit at the bar on the other side of the restaurant, but feel strange doing that since I don't want a drink.  So I wait around for my order holding up my number card to they can see if its me.  \n\nHopefully they are this disorganized because it just opened a few weeks ago, but I would never go back for a take-out meal.

And I just loved the cute little bar, back rest counter high white stools and a full drink selection. Only around for a year and a half, it seemed to already have made a name for itself, with its handful of cut out newspaper reviews proudly framed on the wall as you walk in (and the first thing you would see, which was a nice touch to the place). We guessed from the blown up photo of some dude in a chef outfit crossed armed and full of attitude was the owner/chef himself. All this gave a nice personal touch to the place.\n\nOnce seated, we were served right away by an eager waitress. I ordered the 'Breakfast Special' ($9), although you're tempted to say 'I'll have the Breakfast Special 9' as the number '9' reads as part of the dish name instead of the price itself, perhaps something that can be improved on just for ease of clarity. After the fumble, we were reassured that many make the same mistake. Tea or coffee was included in the special, so I ordered earl gray tea, which was served in a small teapot compressor.\n\nThe menu was the actual table mat, blue and white in color with a fair selection of items. We noticed that their smoked meat sandwich's were a big hit, something to try for next time. We also noticed that the milk was annoyingly served in a small tin container, and there being 5 of us in total, it became a bit ridiculous asking the waitress to keep making multiple trips back to the kitchen to keep re-filling the tiny buggers!\n\nFour of the five meals came out after a 30 minute wait; my boyfriends came out 15 minutes after that. This was a bit annoying to be honest, but compensated for after receiving an apology from the waitress along with a five dollar coupon for our next visit (we're easily pleased) always a nice touch and appreciated. Although for that even extra nice bit of touch (going the extra mile as they say) it would have been even nicer for the 'don't mess with' owner/chef guy to come out in person and apologize for the long wait. I never understand why some restaurants don't do this, it shows the restaurant cares just that little bit extra, changing the customers opinion of the place from 'I got a fiver for my next visit' to telling their friends about it. I saw Mr. attitude himself so he was there.\n\nThe meal was nice and the portion size just right. Eggs were a bit too runny, always a favorite! But their hash browns were yummy, complimented very well with the apple sauce addition. Their bacon was a bit too hard and their fruit salad was just that, fruit! Nothing really here to get me to come back, although I wanna try that meat sandwich!!\n\nThe total bill for the two of us was $27, not bad for what you get. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll give it another shot, I mean we do have that fiver :)", "stars": 4, "cool": 2, "useful": 2, "date": "2011-05-26"}, {"user_id": "3uA4WiG7DkCQP798QEs-Gw", "review_id": "UVO5JiUoYpe_Xj7EEEEJqQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "nxo1C5te8Aug-Lf5D_0b1A", "text": "So sad!!

In addition to this the service was poor both times, the restuarant was empty yet the service was lagging. The waiter would have 20 min conversations with people who clearly were trying to eat dinner and not interested in chatting, but just were being polite. All this while his 2 other tables (mine) and another couple sat and rolled there eyes at eachother.  They were out of major things on the menu. The presentation of the food could use work as well. It just seems like this place is on the cusp of closing down and keeps changing the menu in hopes of it working but need to focus more on perfecting simple items on there initial menu, presentation and service rather than weak attempts to change the menu everytime they get a bad review on here.  The location is great, the interior is great, the patio wonderful. This actual structure has great potential. I know that this is owned by Frank and Lupes, which is excellent, so maybe they need to focus there efforts on one thing and not get too much in the hopper.", "stars": 2, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2011-09-09"}, {"user_id": "LUsNCIM2zqLv-D1eRk2QoA", "review_id": "rBAtgn8w9aQDq3wsz_4Tcw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "e-JcWplcnIx6lRmQoRF-Dw", "text": "Donna does a great job!

Most of the wines are also sorted by color and density(Light Reds, Medium Reds, etc) while the rest are displayed in the rotating floor stands with labels like \"Date Night\", \"Tax Refund\" and \"Girl's Night Out\". All of the wines have cleverly written description cards next to them that are helpful in ascertaining the character of the wine.\n\nTwo wall mounted kiosks also allow you to browse the store's stock and with the recently updated software they are running, track which wines you have purchased and rate them,which is great because I cant always remember what I thought of a particular wine that I may have had a year ago. They will also give you more information about the wine you just tasted (more on that in a sec) and allow you to add wines to your wish-list should a friend or relative happen by and want to know what to bring to that party your hosting. \"Hey Mom, don't show up without a bottle of the Niepoort 20 year if you know whats good for ya!\"\n\nAnyone who drinks wine knows the sad little moment when you take a taste of a wine not yet tried and think, \"I don't like this nearly as much as root-canal.\" To combat this problem the slingers of grapes at Winestore have installed two machines imported from Italy called Enorounds, one for Whites and one for Reds that allow you to sample wines. You purchase a Winestore card, putting whatever amount of money you wish on it, insert the card into the Enoround, push a button and a sample will be poured for you by the machine. Not only does it allow you to try before you buy, it makes shopping for wine a lot more fun.\n\nWhat really makes the store stand out for me as my absolute favorite is that the owners, Matt and Keith, have taken the time to get to know me as a customer, are always willing to take the time to discuss particular wines with me and have become familiar with my tastes and will gladly recommend wines for me when asked.  For those of us that love wine, but aren't really educated on what grape is what and what region produces which to what effect, purchasing wine can be somewhat daunting. Not at Winestore. While there are a few good places to buy wine in Charlotte, Winestore is my absolute favorite.", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2008-07-31"}, {"user_id": "iLzOjHz1KO95FyPXr3V-aw", "review_id": "TbgObBpsvnCzsCBkppZgOw", "funny": 2, "business_id": "sR8abAg-zKxqE0HkICA-4A", "text": "I am WAAAAAAAYYYYY overdue for a visit to Down To The Bone.

I have only met the lady doctor once before and it was pleasant but Dr.Michael is usually the one I see when I get a check up and he is quick and efficient.\n\nThe hygienist is very honest, patient and thorough.

The experience is completely different from dental offices 15-20 years ago. My whole family, including my kids, love her. You can see the difference when you sit with Karen because she cares. My first appointment with the office several years ago started with her. I used to hate dental offices and Karen completely reassured that dental offices are not something to fear.

Management bent over backwards to convince us to move in, but once we moved in, it appeared as though their priorities shifted to luring other suckers into moving in. \n\nSeveral advertisements for 1055 Bloor highlight the beautiful indoor pool, which was our main reason for moving in. We had full use of the pool for two days, after which the heat was turned off without notice. Then it was closed for \"major repairs\" according to Almira, the building manager. The pool was, however, permanently closed without noticed in favour of a \"gym\" which required little to no maintenance. \n\nNo reduction in rent was offered when this amenity was taken away. Management reasoned this was fair, because they were opening the new gym, which was also advertised to attract renters. \n\nThe \"secure\" garage we pay to park in is anything but secure. When we moved in, the door knob was on the floor for several days. Then, when it became obvious that the antiquated locking mechanism was too difficult to open for too many people, someone jammed the lock open permanently. This was not remedied until the building switched to an electronic FOB system months later. How our vehicle was never broken into, damaged or stolen is beyond me. \n\nThe fire department is located nearby, which is convenient, because it's not uncommon for the fire alarm to go off several times over the course of a day, or late at night. These are often false alarms. At least one of which went on for 30 minutes, because the fire department was not notified, and residents were treated to the loud disruption well after 11pm while the inept superintendent attempted to disable the alarm himself to prevent the fire department from charging the company for the fourth false alarm of the day. \n\nRepairs are done on a when-we-feel-like-it basis. It took THREE MONTHS to fix a hole in the ceiling above our bathtub, and the ceiling wasn't replaced, it was only given a poor patch job. \n\nApartments are poorly ventilated.

We had the Jatoba salad with lobster pieces, spice-crusted beef carpaccio, a variety of sashimi from Albacore to Blue fin, another course of every type of dumplings, gigantic pieces of succulent shrimp tempura, seared scallops in browned butter, ginger lobster with grilled gai lan, and my coworkers even had the beef with grilled foie gras, while I opted for the buttery grilled king oyster mushrooms.  \n\nEach dish was a marriage of fresh and interesting flavour profiles, with classic additions such as grilled shishito pepper and pickled daikon to dwarf peaches and cucumber mixed with the lovely texture of roe and the melt-in-your-mouth fish. Delicate flavours were preserved, yet paired with bold tastes which would please even the most discerning of palates.\n\nEven the desserts were exquisite; although none of the eight of us has a particularly sweet tooth, we couldn't turn away the last course, which was plates of the mango curd tart with meringue brul\u00e9 and green apple sorbet and a great take on the humble but delectable pouding chomeur topped with vanilla bean ice cream and raspberries. \n\nIn all of my experience dining out, I can easily say this was one of the top three meals I've ever had.

Best NY style pizza i have had outside of the real NY. And I'm a New Yorker.\n\nFirst time we went was our first night in Vegas. Trying to grab a quick bite after seeing a show. We ate outside on the patio and ate our slices next to the pretty waterfalls late at night. Very nice.\n\nSecond time we came in for lunch with a larger group. Very busy, long line. \n\nThey also have a vegan menu here (you have to ask for it, but every restaurant at the Wynn hotel has a vegan menu). My sister, the vegan, had a vegan sandwich (veggies on vegan bread) which she said was awesome.\n\nHere comes the bad news for vegans. This is a order-at-the-counter then go sit down and wait for your food to be brought to you place. The lady behind the counter who took our order was an english as a second language person. We told her repeatedly that my sister was vegan and everything she was ordering needed to be vegan. We pointed at the vegan menu several times. She still kept asking every time we ordered something, do you want that with cheese? Do you want the vegan one? YES, WE WANT THE VEGAN ONE we said, LOUDLY while pointing at the vegan menu. O.k., so at the end, we thought we had properly communicated that we needed all vegan food for my sister. On the vegan menu were vegan garlic fries, which we ordered. We made it CRYSTAL CLEAR we needed the VEGAN garlic fries, not the regular ones. Seriously, we said it SEVERAL times. Well, my sister gets her sandwich and fries and starts to eat. I say, what's that stuff on top of your fries? She said she thought it was big chunks of garlic. Then she takes a closer look and realizes it's cheese. We go to the counter and complain. The manager comes out. They replace the fries with vegan ones, but the manager seems to be blaming my sister for not ordering the right fries. Are you kidding me? We could not possibly have been any clearer. Seriously, this is a very big deal to vegans. No apology, no offer of compensation, nothing. Very disappointed in how that was handled.\n\nHere's some advice for Mr. Wynn. If you want vegans to eat at your restaurants, you need to ensure that the staff at all your restaurants understand the vegan issue, and that they speak english fluently.

My husband, son and I got there in no time. Twenty bucks for all of us to get in seemed pretty reasonable, and we thought we would use the ten dollar voucher for the restaurant that you get upon entry.\n\nI know lots of people have given this place positive reviews across the internet, but there are some down sides to Bonnie Springs. My husband and I took our one year old to see the petting zoo, and we tried to take the stroller in, but it was VERY hard to maneuver over the gravel that was in the old west town. There are numerous wooden stairs everywhere as well. If you are in a wheelchair, be warned, this is a very non-handicapped-accessible location. I wouldn't bother.\n\nThey don't have many signs telling you exactly where the petting zoo is. You kind of have to wander around until you find the actual \"petting\" part. In actuality, there are very few animals loose to pet. At least when we went there was one goat, and a few very sleepy deer that were tolerant. The rest of the animals were behind cages (for safety sake, of course). All the animals seemed fairly well taken care of. There were a few cases where I question the animal's health, but nothing drastic.\n\nWe cut our losses and didn't try the restaurant. Since it's so close to Vegas, it was more appetizing to go back into town and grab something there. We didn't make the effort to see any of the wild west performances, either. It was hot and baby was tired.\n\nI would say that overall we had a good time. I'm glad we gave the place a chance and checked it out. The animals did make my son smile, and there was a lot to look at, but I can't see going back any time soon.", "stars": 3, "cool": 0, "useful": 2, "date": "2007-04-29"}, {"user_id": "8EB12cOJ7Lpt7Q_qXtChRg", "review_id": "WcMnK1Tn-Kx1iDt8qmU5SA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "5KBbN8dV8_bGHxqEhkn31A", "text": "Fantastic little Ma & Pa's place!

She kind of glared at me and walked away after pointing to the pedi chair for me to sit in.  I sat there for over 15 minutes waiting and she was no where to be seen.  Not one person acknowledge me or cared that I was just sitting there.  By the time Kim came over she did not even look at me once through my entire appointment.  I told her I wanted my toe nails square and cut short but to not cut the sides with the cuticle cutters. She proceeded to cut two toe nails out of the ten.  It had been about two months since my last pedi (I usually come every two weeks) so it was obvious my nails needed to be cut.  When I asked her to please cut them she kind of snarled and was so annoyed.  She hardly filed them and the scrub at end was pointless.  My nails are uneven and look horrible. She may have been having a bad day but a pedi is a treat for me and if she is grumpy she shouldn't have helped me.  I also sat in between two elderly women who were so friendly and kind and their techs were not friendly.  I won't return to this shop.

The whole experience was contrary to what I expected though.  \nFirst, the cash part.  Come on, what is the reason for not taking credit cards when the whole world accepts it?  That you might die and credit card might not get cleared?  \nSecond, the menu.  Just a handful of items?  I was expecting something more than just a burger / fries and hot dog.  \nThird, the food itself.  If you make your burger in lard and is supposed to have 1000s of calories, it should be tasty, rt?  Or so I thought.  I finished it only because I just wanted to avoid a scene of arguing with them that I don't want spanking even if I did not finish food (though most of the people over there seemed to enjoy it - maybe I am the minority, but it was not fun for me).  I think it is the chilli that spoiled the taste of the burger.  But whatever it is, the taste was nothing to write about.\nFourth, the ambiance.  I will rate the indoor atmosphere only at the same level of McDonalds or Burger King.  \nFifth, the security - locked doors only to be opened by security after verifying you paid.  Why?  I mean, they seriously make you feel like you are in a mental assylum with the nurses costumes and the spanking machine in the middle.  No problem for me with a restaurant having security, but I have never seen any one watching at the door so closely as if people eating there might run away in the middle without paying.\nI definitely think they have a unique theme that can attract people.  But make a great tasty food worth the calories and improve the ambiance - it can be a game changer.  Also, please be a bit more family friendly or advise that this is not a family friendly place.

I had such a good experience that I started having my oil changes and smog checks done there as well. Last Friday 10.31.14 I stopped in to have my oil changed without an appointment, they were very busy so i decide to make an appointment, the attendant suggested to me that Sunday was their slowest day so I made an appointment for 8 am Sunday morning.\nI arrived at 8:02 am to find 5 people in front of me to drop off my keys and only one person attending to people, not a big deal they got busy, I understand. In listening to the people in front of me I realized that none of them had appointments so when I got to the counter at 8:20, just to drop off my keys I asked if what the man on Friday had told me would still be true, that I would be out of there by 9:00 AM? \nHe said that I was not on time and now there were many people in front of me. I said again I have an appointment and I WAS there on time and had been standing in line for 20 minutes and I want to make sure that I would  be in front of the people that did not have appointments?\n\nHe told me again that I was not there on time, I said I was there on time and had been standing in line for 20 minutes which he clearly knew. He then started to argue with me about what time I arrived in front of the whole room full of people, stating I was not in line when he opened the doors at 8 am, which i was not. I was there at 8:02 am.\nI again said I just wanted to make sure that since I had an appointment that my car would be serviced before those that did not bother to make and appointment. He then went on a rant a bout how whenever he has an appointment he is there on time etc. He just wanted to argue IMO.\n\nWhen I made the appointment on Friday I asked the attendant at the time what the earliest was that I could drop off the car and he told me 8 am, I didn't realize at the time that making an appointment to help them with their staff scheduling was a waste of my time and that it all depends on your place in the line before the place even opens. I then asked for my keys and said we were just going to leave. He then made a some comment about not being able to do magic. Basically a good riddance.\n\nKeep in mind all i did was ask the question, not in a confrontational way at all, I just needed to  verify that my appointment would still put me in front of the walk-ins as it should. I have since discovered that he is the manager and  that he has a history of rude and unprofessional  behavior. I took the car to Freddy's and paid more for the work which I am happy to do for good customer service. It got in at Freddy's right away.\n\nBottom line? Avoid this location unless you like abuse and very poor customer service should you be unlucky enough to get this guy. it had been about 3 months since I was last there so I don't know if this guy is new or what but my experience definitely changed.\n\nFYI, everyone else I have ever dealt with at  this location was great.

Where it fell flat for my party were the items on the menu and the food that came out. We had noted an allergy in the original reservation and after a phone call and promise of the allergy being taken seriously, it presented as the main fish on the menu. This limited our ability to partake in the 5 course tasting which is why we originally went. So we opted for 3. The food focused on small portions with unique gastronomy and plating. The taste and overall finish of the food could have been improved upon as my pork dish seemed under cooked and was leaking blood, it had the texture of raw bacon. The worst part for me was, I wasn't certain if this is how fancy restaurants cook meat and I was uncomfortable saying anything. The serving sizes are small but I suppose that is to be expected with the price of a multi-course dinner being so fair. So the reason I gave a three rating isn't because we hated it nor because we really liked it. It simply was an experience that we likely wouldn't repeat. We would rather spend our money somewhere that was more comfortable with larger portions and food that focused on taste and less on fancy cooking techniques (there was a lot of foam) and left us feeling fulfilled.", "stars": 3, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2017-08-08"}, {"user_id": "rSlsywnkymvlvggoGDCx3g", "review_id": "p_bXAuEJafq2mRjGUOf5fA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "Y2Z7sMQV8vK3Uva3wWXjPQ", "text": "Bubbles is my favourite car detailing place in Calgary.

Then as we drive past Dream Palace, he starts talking about wanting us to stop and go in. He also told me his theory is why hang out with a 5 when you can buy a 10? We get back and sit down at the computer and he had to get a manager to enter something on the computer. While the manager was sitting at the desk, the salesman proceeds to tell the manager about this woman we saw. I can't remember the word he used to describe her.

I started working with Hali in the beginning and since we weren't quite sure what we wanted, and knew we needed indoor and outdoor signage, she referred me to their outside sales rep, Mandy. \n\nThings were good at first, Mandy came out to our location at no charge to do some measurements and get more information from me. She left after telling me she would get me a quote within the next day however, I did not hear from her for a week. After sending an e-mail to see when I would receive a quote- I got an e-mail with one the next day. After about a week of back and forth Q&A I told her we were ready to go forward with the project. I did not hear back from anyone after six days so  I sent Hali an e-mail on the 16th of September asking why I had not heard back from anyone, I finally got an e-mail from Mandy on the 17th; by that time had already decided to seek out another vendor. \n\nThe vendor we talked with quoted us almost twice as much as what Fast Signs did, so I will commend them on their pricing. \n\nI had to ask them to revise the proof they sent to me four times because they kept sending me incorrect proofs. The first proof that was sent wasn't even a proof for our company.\n\nWe paid half of the payment, and I let them know that we were ready to have everything installed except for one indoor sign, as we were repainting and doing some rearranging. \n\nThey showed up with only one sign to install, and nothing else. I asked them where everything else was and he told me that they said I only wanted one sign installed. I had to let him know exactly what my e-mail said, and after he called the store, the owner, Sam came out to help install the rest of the signs except for the one sign we weren't ready for.\n\nThe signs for our front door have a white border- in which I pointed out to another sign we have, as a reference to the width of the white border we wanted- the signs they printed have almost twice the size border we wanted. In the proof it did not look as big, so we approved it. \n\nAfter telling Sam about my issues with the slow response times, the multiple proofs, and the border width, he apologized, but offered no means to satisfy myself or my CEO. The only thing he offered was a 10% discount if we wanted to reprint the signs.\n\nIt is my belief that a company that offers a product or service should ensure a customer is 100% satisfied with it.\n\nI am extremely disappointed with the service we received with this location.

I had dinner last night (a Wednesday night) and though it was busy (they had a huge group sitting), it was still as relaxing, peaceful and enjoyable as all of my other visits.  \n\nThe decor is modern chic with a relaxed flair - completely beautiful.  It might appear pretentious to some, but the amazing, friendly staff have always consistently made me feel warm and welcome (I never once experienced attitude by anyone).\n\nI was also there last Friday and was served by the same server, Katie, who was just as attentive, friendly and warm.\n\nBecause I'm a regular, I've tried a lot of different things (but not everything because to keep things fresh and moving, they do change their menu every once in a while).  \n\nMy go to appetizer is always the zucchini chips - fresh, light, not over fried or dripping in grease, perfect crispness and a great aioli sauce to accompany them.  My second favourite is the polenta fries (not great when they're cold, so eat while they're still warm!).  My husband loves their spicy tacos and though I hate spicy food, I did try a bit and they were good.\n\nI will always highly recommend their short rib main - the beef is so tender that you don't need a knife.  This meat will melt in your mouth and you end up needing to pull pieces away with just your fork.  It's the most tender meat dish I've ever had; also came with root vegetables, mashed potatoes and gravy - perfect accompaniments (one friend substituted the mash with fries at a different dinner and it was nice, too).  To avoid myself from having it a third time in a row, my friend ordered it (gave me a small piece to share) and this time, I had the spaghettoni with seafood.  The pesto was great and it was nice and light.  Small scallops, but good size shrimps and definitely a good serving size.  \n\nFor dessert, I recommended the carrot cake to my friend and she loved it (I had some, too) and I ordered the phyllo-wrapped cheesecake with blueberry compote (to die for).  Both the carrot cake and cheesecake were incredibly moist, fresh, sweet but not too sweet and a good serving size.  I have a sweet tooth and though I love sweets, I hate when it's overdone and they do sweets here perfectly.\n\nThough we had finished our desserts and had just been chatting for a while, Katie attentively refilled our waters and coffee without asking and her great service made the experience that much better.\n\nIn the past, some of the other dishes I've had were the pizza (flat crust - nice and light), steak and frites (nice and traditional), salmon (also nice and light) and their burger (juicy, fresh and filling).  \n\nWe're coming here again...and again...and again...", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "date": "2017-05-11"}, {"user_id": "29od6ooFUin927cO9V2RBQ", "review_id": "nrnm5HT5x27Znf2b8DxJ1A", "funny": 0, "business_id": "euL4wrPoczkOBkS93pxv5A", "text": "I always loved eating here over the years.

My wife describes her as thebomb.com and I simply appreciated and thoroughly enjoyed every conversation wit her. She was timely, respectful, friendly, sharp, hilarious and just a blast to be around.  I will sincerely miss communicating with her all the time but I still intend to bug her just because she is so wonderful. She gave me the best set of vendors to work with and the whole wedding went off like a well-oil machine. We were able to customize so much to make it our own but it wouldn't have been possible to achieve that level of perfection anywhere else. Boojum Tree will forever hold such a special place in my heart. If I ever find myself driving by the area during an open house on Tuesday night, I'm just going to pretend I'm getting married all over again to experience it's atmosphere.

The quality of their fish, menu variety, and prices are unbeatable!  My bf brought me here after reading some yelp reviews but I was extremely skeptical.  After moving from LA about 3 years ago, I have not been able to find a good sushi spot in Phoenix.  Ive tried so many places guided by yelp, but was always disappointed.  Luckily, we stumbled upon this gem!  Everyone was so friendly and the service was amazing! I work in the restaurant industry, so I am definitely a critic when it comes to good service.  The owner, Juno, was so personable and genuine, he really made our night special  The staff was accommodating and knowledgeable about the food.  This was certainly the cherry on our evening.  They use purple sushi rice for their rolls and nigiri, which is much healthier than plain white sushi rice.  I was a little hesitant when I saw the purple rice, but it was delicious!!! My bf earned many brownie points for finding Harumi.  They also have a location in Scottsdale called Kodo Sushi that we will definitely be trying. Must try this place!!

They call and argue that there's no place to park while I can see from our window that they're already parked while we're on the phone.

This store doesn't seem like they wanted to please their customers at all...When I got home and opened the box, some of the chicken were not freshly cooked.

He was incredibly professional and friendly once I arrived, and took me through the shop and showed me around before his guys went to work on the car. He took the time to answer my questions regarding my own detailing techniques and was really informative regarding his products. Not only that, but he brought me the WiFi password to use while I waited for the car to get cleaned.\n\nThe car came out looking awesome, and both the employees who did the detail work did a great job and were very friendly.

The only criticism I can give is that since they expanded the dining room last year, the kitchen sometimes gets backed up when they are swamped (more seats but no extra kitchen = slower food) so you will sometimes wait a little longer for your food. We always have some type of special request on our order (extra cheese or sauce, no sausage, etc) and they always get it right. \n\nI definitely recommend Ronnie's, and have sent many friends there, but if you've never been there before, you may want to go on a week day when they aren't so swamped.

The owner spoke cantonese too.  So it was a good thing we walked in.\n\nThe food was excellent.  The portions were also huge so you are better off ordering just one dish per person for 2 or even share 2 dishes amongst 3.  Plenty!  The beef dish was tender and had that cooked over a high flame taste.  Yummy.  The fried shashimo with salt and peppers was delicious!  The congee was smooth and comforting as well.  Yum!  The free dessert of cut orange slices was a good end to a terrific meal.\n\nThe decor is simple but the place gets kinda crowded and you may be asked to share one of the bigger tables.

It was not a \"SAUCE\" as much as a generous serving of sliced mushroom piled on top of the beautifully seared duck.  Nice touch.

In fact, my favorite server from Sweet Lulu on Queen West turned up at the Adelaide Street location.  He is wonderful.  And the servers really know the menu, including the wine list. I've always been impressed. \n\nI live just around the corner from Terroni on Queen and I always marvel at the line-ups when there are so many other good choices within a few blocks.  I end up there every once in a while because friends want to go, or because we want to go somewhere kid friendly with our two year old.  I have to hand it to them--they are really accommodating of kids.  They don't bat an eyelash when you come in with a stroller and ask for a high chair.  The only rudeness I've experienced is from the patrons waiting in line, who seem really put out when they need to move six inches so I can get out the door.  \n\nThe food has always been good, sometimes fantastic.  I've never had anything terrible, but last night I had a just ok dish for the first time: the spaghetti alla norma.  The pasta was perfectly al dente as always, but the tomato sauce lacked flavor and the chunks of deep fried eggplant were soggy and bland.  I started with the giuggiolosa salad, which was wonderful and kept the meal from being a loss.  \n\nThe pizzas are really tasty, and the spaghetti with lemon and capers is one of my favorites.  The pasta portions are pretty small for the money, I find.  They are just the right size, if you ask me, compared to the monstrous portions at other places, but $16 or so for a small portion of vegetarian pasta seems excessive to me.  \n\nMy biggest peeve is that the salads are all just shy of entree size, which means too large to be starters, but at entree salad prices.  It feels indulgent (and it is expensive) to get a salad and a pasta, but pasta alone isn't enough veg for me, and a salad alone isn't filling enough.\n\nActually, that's my second biggest pet peeve.  My biggest is the little note on the menu that says, \"While alterations may seem easily accommodated they compromise the unique characteristics of our food.  Please respect our menu.\"  I find that really obnoxious.  \n\nI'm sure I'll be back, not even kicking and screaming, but it just doesn't live up to the hype for me.", "stars": 3, "cool": 2, "useful": 3, "date": "2010-02-01"}, {"user_id": "uWeAWWzKpOl6o7V-BdtUGg", "review_id": "_Kb4Je9PoUgDv1pQRMlYcw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "hm0y7QxT-UUmQcF074qV0g", "text": "Great coffee (I've had lattes and iced coffee), wonderful service, extraordinary croissants, fantastic sandwiches, and the best music ever.

The entire staff was tremendous, which alas is not all that common at popular hangouts with frequent 30-60 minute waits.

And if that's all you're looking for, Marathon will not disappoint.\n\nIf you're like me, however, and expect good, African flavour for your money, I suggest you look elsewhere. The stews - I had their staple beef, chicken, lamb, and chickpea stews  - are all fairly uninteresting, many of them rich in the flavour of their tomato base and little else. If it hadn't been for the somewhat smokey lamb, I'd liken the experience to eating pasta with tomato sauce at a cheap Italian chain restaurant.  For what you are paying - e.g.: $18/person if you do the dinner combo platter - the serving sizes are quite small and though the injera is plentiful, it is too bland to eat on its own. \n\nIt's unfortunate because there are not many options for Ethiopian/Eritrean food in the city.

Automatically I started thinking that I don't know if I would want to eat at a place that eludes to anything that is gastrointestinal related.  However, my curiosity continued to get the best of me despite the name, so I checked out the website.  I was impressed with what I saw.  I'm a crazy picky eater so there are some dishes on the menu that you couldn't pay me to try, but there were also several that excited my stomach.  I'm a music junkie so I became even more excited when I read that different local DJs hit the ones and twos every night!  I said to myself, \"Self, we are so going to Soul Gastrolounge!\"  \n\nOne of my friends and I met up there on a Friday night around 9:00 and the place was packed!  There's a really cool outdoor patio that overlooks the street and inside is dimly lit and full of a laid-back, eccentric vide.  I thought to myself, \"I've found where I belong (tear, sniffle, sniffle).\"  My friend and I were told that we would have an hour and 15 minute wait, which normally would've sent us packing but we were fully committed.  So, we chose to wait at Twenty-Two (check out my review) which is right below S.G.\n\nWhen it was time for us to be seated we were lead to a bar right by the DJ booth (who was awesome btw).  Our server came by in a matter of seconds to take our drink orders and then we perused the menu.  Since I had already looked at it online I decided to order the Soul Wings (I wasn't feeling as adventurous that night but trust me I'll going back to try oh so much more.) and the french fries with garlic-herb salt, pecorino & truffle oil.  The wings were okay but I loved the fries.  Our server came back to check on us several times throughout our stay and was pretty darn amazing.  \n\nI'll definitely be back here.

Now, if you want to get fancy and have some extra doe to spend, you can choose from a number of custom fabrics and put your own personal touch on the furniture style of your choice.  \n\nI spent a few days after I purchased my sectional looking at other furniture stores for accent chairs and couldn't find anything.  So, I went back to Havertys and found a chair style that I really liked and picked out a custom fabric.

If you're not into combing racks for buried treasures resale shops may not be the places for you.  For me finding great deals on some awesome clothes is almost like winning a game even though your team was down with only 5 seconds left on the clock.  Perseverance plus dedication to the win (landing multiple good deals) = VICTORY!  However, if you're not as hard core as I am but still like going to the occasional resale shop let me help you navigate this store.\n\nThe Wearhouse is very well organized and divided into two sections.  The front section of the store is consignment which includes the designer brands.  I've seen brands from Marc Jacobs and DVF to J.Crew and Seven for All Mankind.  These items can be a bit pricey but you can still find some really good deals.  Towards the back of the store is the thrift section.  Some of the brands I've seen in this section have been Express, Forever 21 and those that can be found in any typical clothing store.  The thrift items are significantly less expensive than the consignment items but there are more to sift through.  \n\nThe great thing about the pricing of many of the items is that after a specific date the price goes down.  For example, you've just found a jacket in consignment in which your mind flashes through all of the different places you will wear it and the numerous compliments you'll receive.  When you snap back to reality you realize that although the jacket may enhance your life, it's a bit more than you want to spend.  No worries, just look on the price tag and there is information on the exact date in which the price will be reduced and what it will be reduced to.  \n\nAnother great perk about shopping at JLC Wearhouse is that there are sales all of the time.  There is also a frequent shopper program in which you can get 30% off of a purchase after you make 5 purchases of $25.  Sounds great right?  If I haven't enticed you to check out the store yet maybe a recount of my last shopping spree will!\n2 pairs of J. Crew pants\n1 pair of purple palazzo pants (Only $4!

Unfortunately the mattress was like a nightmare (cue the \"Psycho\" shower scene music), I just wanted to wake up from it and never crawl back in.  \n\nWhen I decided to stop renting my furniture the first thing I bought was a mattress.  Thanks to a $200 credit to Mattress Firm that I purchased on Groupon, the decision on where to buy my mattress set was made for me.  Before I actually went to the store I checked out the Mattress Firm website to get an idea of how much mattress sets were.  To my surprise there was a short questionnaire that asked about my sleeping patterns and then provided me with mattress choices that would best suit me.  As a result I was able to go into the store and tell Nick, the awesome store manager, exactly what type of mattress I was looking for.  I purchased a plush Hampton and Rhodes mattress set that is so comfortable that I've been having to hit the snooze button twice ever since it was delivered.\n\nI also had a great experience with the delivery.  The two guys that delivered the mattress set helped me to put covers on the boxspring and the mattress without me even having to ask.  Overall my experience with Mattress Firm was top notch.

We ordered a lot, 2 of the \"large\" sausage and cheese samplers, the loaves of bread and creme spreads, jerky sampler, petit fours mix, salted caramel petit fours, Brownie Cups, butter cookies, brie wheel, cranberry chipotle cheese, cheddar cheese, the butter cheese (Can't remember the exact name) cheese curds, and that flat fried cheese that looks like the Greek dish called Saganaki. So this was not a small 1st order, really, I was stupid for ordering so much without having any experience with them, and let me tell you why:\n\nFirst off, I live in Tucson, AZ and while it is December, the days still get well into 80 degree temps. This arrived through USPS, everything was in its own separate shipping box, (One box completely crushed, but luckily no damage, but that is on USPS, not the Cheeseman) and I do mean EVERYTHING was in separately addressed shipping boxes! It was about 10 shipping boxes all stacked together and wrapped in a sort of plastic, and then 3 or 4 loose boxes. For all being in different shipping containers, I received 3 ice packs total for the entire order, which were completely melted and not even cool anymore upon arrival. My brie wheel was a floppy mess! All cheeses were at that stage just before melting, very, very, very soft. I didn't have the heart to look at the chocolate, but I probably should. I just know if I open those Petits or brownie cups, they will get eaten long before Christmas day...lol \nI just don't understand why they have all that packaging but hardly any ice packs for such a large order going to the desert. If they don't pay attention to where they are shipping in order to pack appropriately, they should. You wouldn't pack an order destined for Michigan, right next door to Wisconsin and much cooler, in the same way that you would to the desert in Arizona. Not only does it take longer to arrive here, but it will face different temps and heat in the mail trucks than the one going to Michigan or what have you.\n\nOkay, so we start opening boxes and I come to the loaves of bread and creme spreads. All I could do was laugh; I buy on eBay a lot and a huge issue I have is ordering something and when it arrives it is either gigantic or tiny compared to what I thought I bought. Yes, I check measurements, but for some reason this still happens. So anyways, I was \"ebayed\" on the bread loaves. These loaves are about an inch and a half to 2 inches wide by 3 inches long. Hardly a loaf, perhaps a loaf for an 18 inch doll, but not full size humans. I would feel like a doofus serving someone thee tiniest slice of bread ever. The loaf itself is about one serving. Just a fair warning. The \"large\" sausage and cheese packs were the same way, maybe an inch and a half in diameter by 3 inches long? I knew they wouldn't be full sized amounts, they never are in sampler packs, but even so, I was shocked at the price to size ratio.\n\nGranted, the only thing I have opened and tried were the butter cookies and they're okay. (I think Royal Dansk are better, honestly. I really wish I had gone for the baklava instead, but it threw me off the way it said it was made with a honey flavored syrup, not actual honey. Why? Why not real honey? Anyway,  these issues still stand even if this food is the yummiest I've ever had once we eat it. That is why I didn't wait until eating it to review. I know a lot of people got that catalog last week and I hope this helps someone before Christmas.

And to that I say... \"who cares\".  I personally didn't care for the fries and slaw inside my sandwich, but I am also not a huge french fry or cole slaw fan. (I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. \n\nThe ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients. \n\nOn the plus side, the sandwiches average about $7 each, and for that price, your get a pretty decent sandwich.

I give Ernie an (A) on that level. Based on what I saw. This has to do with lack of communication with customers in regards to work being done on your Concession trailer. Ernie and I spent 45mins on phone going over every appliance, equipment and materials that was going to be installed in my trailer. Ernie quoted me a price and I continued shopping around because I FELT it was a little HIGH. A couple of days later I got a call from a co-worker asking me what happen because I never called back and I explain to co-worker how I felt about price,that it was high. I explained to co-worker I had a complete layout of trailer with everything I wanted installed on my trailer and for Ernie to look over it to see if he could give me a better price. Few hours passed, I got a call back, we agreed on a lower price of about 6000.00 dollars. I agreed to take my trailer to his shop on his new estimate. Ernie claimed my trailer would be worth 60k when he's done for a 40k job. I said Thank You! I live in California which is 377 miles away one way. I ask about a contract, Ernie claims he would have contract ready for me when I dropped trailer off. I agreed. Big MISTAKE. Next day I left for Arizona around 1:00pm, I explained to Ernie I wouldn't arrive until around 8:00pm, Ernie said no problem, he only lives 2 miles from shop and he would meet me there. I said cool, that's nice of him. On my way up I called Ernie when I was 30mins away, that I will be arriving soon, he explained to me he was still at shop, that he was leaving and to just drop trailer off in front of roll up door by his office. I felt very uncomfortable doing that and I ask Ernie if he would just wait at shop until I got there so I could meet him and pick up contract. I ask Ernie about contract, if it was ready, Ernie said no, Ernie ask me if tomorrow was ok, that he would send it to me via email, I said I will talk to you when I get there. I arrived about 8:15pm, we talked and he showed me around shop. Ernie showed me a trailer in which he posted on Facebook and sent to me via text showing me his workmanship and what I was getting in my trailer. While there looking at trailer he was completing, I ask about generator location on trailer, I ask if that's were he was putting my generator, Ernie's response was, you don't have a generator for your trailer, I said what, I sent you a complete layout with a generator in wish Ernie claims was (optional), I explained to Ernie optional met brand of generator, not with or without one like Ernie's theory, I mention to Ernie I couldn't operate a trailer without a generator, plus we talked about it on the phone in our first conversation, before I sent layout that I emailed to you. Plus if it was a concern, why didn't Ernie ask me about it before giving me a price, I know why, he knew we talked about it already over phone. That's when the fun begins and price skyrockets like the shuttle going to mars. That would be an additional 5-7k on price quote. I was like wtf happening here, I started asking Ernie questions about trailer he sent me via text, about the inside of trailer because I was very concern by now where this was heading, I ask Ernie if my trailer was going to looked like the inside of this trailer, he said no way, I said what, Ernie claims this is a 63-65k job, your only paying 40k, so I ask, what I'm I getting? He showed me a food truck with a 3 bay sink just standing, with plumbing and pipes showing, I said to myself, hell no, I'm not paying 40k for that shit.Ernie stated my trailer will not come with cabinets nowhere in my trailer, I'm thinking in my head, why would he send me a video with cabinets and all this fancy appliances in it and then claim he was installing equipment like the food truck he just showed me. If Ernie would of showed me that food truck from the beginning and appliances, I would of never ever driven to his place for that price. I ask how much to have cabinets installed in my trailer,10k more. I was like f that, now I'm looking at 55-57k, in which my very first estimate was 46k before dropping it down to 40k. I mentioned to Ernie I needed to talk to my wife about new price, we both decided not do the job with Ernie, so I hooked my trailer back up and drove back to California that night. What a lonely drive back with a very pissed off wife because I didn't get a contract before I went to Arizona. There's NO such thing about Meaning of the Minds anymore. What a waste of time, money and mileage on my new truck. So the THEORY of my review is, GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING & ON CONTRACT, COMPLETE DETAIL OF JOB and A COMPLETE ITEMIZED LIST of Parts and Appliances. Good Luck! BTW ERNIE....SHAME ON YOU!!!!!

The smoke was so dense as if someone was standing next to our beds and smoking in our faces!\nTo remind you, we asked for a NON-SMOKING room, which I assume will be placed on a non-smoking floor, or am I wrong?\nIt is unacceptable to me that my baby will wake up coughing in the middle of the night because the room is full of smoke - after I paid for a non-smoking environment. \nIn addition, my parents were in the next room - experiencing that exact smoke experience. My mother just recovered from cancer, and this is a health hazard for her.\nI would recommend to change the air filters because when comparing this hotel to others (Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Cesar's Palace, Wynn, New York New York, and many more) - this is the hotel with the worst cigarette smell in the lobby. \nThe only good experiences we had are the pool and the \"House Hash a Go Go\" restaurant.\nWe are extremely disappointed from this experience, and will make sure to share it with our family, friends, and colleagues.\n\n\nHere is their response:\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to write and for making us aware of your experience at Rio Las Vegas. Your comments are appreciated as it enables us to identify what we are doing correctly to satisfy our guests, as well as, discovering where adjustments can be made so we may continue providing the best products and service.\n\nI am truly sorry that you were faced with breakdowns during your visit.

It's obvious by your email that we have some opportunity for improvement. There is certainly no excuse for you not to receive the best service we have to offer. Many of our customers consider Rio Las Vegas their home away from home, so I am disappointed that the same service and comfort was not what you experienced.

I hope you will take some comfort in knowing that all customer comments are taken seriously. Your business is truly appreciated. We hope you will give us another chance to serve you again in the near future.

Well, \"No\". Inadvertently, perhaps. Certinally the staff feel confident their handling of the dogs which they attend to are in excellent care. Again, perhaps. However, please see for yourself before dropping your loved ones off for a week or even a day. I encourage you to download Camp Bow Wows app before you decide. \nMy wife was going on vacation. Trying to consider my long hours at work she took it upon herself to book our two dogs at the Westlake Ohio location. Unfortunately , she failed to do her homework. So, I decided to watch the live feed to see if my dogs were okay. After two days of watching twenty plus dogs in a \"bull-pin\" type in closed area with a small outside area which didn't offer any real grass or enough room to run, excersise , or simply play. I also noticed there were no toys. As I continued to watch, there was no human interaction. Family pets obviously need human interaction. The dogs were not being walked nor were they being taken outside for bathroom breaks and probably because it is  easier to mop a tiled floor opposed to cleaning artificial grass carpet. Also, I noticed one of the male staff members was sitting on this small landing of sorts in the center of the room. As the dogs were coming over to him for attention he would bat them away. This recording was on 7 /24/17 in the small pet area. These dogs sit in this room within an open warehouse. The \"bull-pins\" are sectioned off into groups of size and or tempermant as far as I understood. These dogs sit in this room by the door waiting within an atmosphere of very loud constant barking. \nIn my opinion, this place isn't good. I felt sorry for the dogs there when I nearly sped as fast as I could to rescue my two boys. After two days of watching the live feed, it was all I could take. Ask yourself. \" How can you expect your bet to rest without nervousness amongst constant loud barking. Camp Bow Wow distracts the reality as they use \"Camp\" as well as their \"cute\" play on words relating to \"k9', pet, dog and puppy. Notice when the dogs are out of the \"bull-pins\". There will be a memo stating the dogs are asleep from a busy day. Really? Your dog doesn't need a \"Camp\". They need attention, human interaction, behavioral  enforcement, bathroom breaks, walks. Most of all, \"A family setting\". \nWatch for yourself on Camp Bow Wows live feed. In my opinion. It is sad.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "date": "2017-07-28"}, {"user_id": "jROjNHY_EUaz0T5bC_06yg", "review_id": "ri3U4JBFT7_ZvtE8b0PgXQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "olwnQPTEz4uq23HUrJB77w", "text": "I was truly disappointed today with  this store's policy.

For the most part they did a decent job HOWEVER they completely painted one of my rooms incorrectly.  \n\nMy interior designer and I did something fun in the kids bathroom - we did horizontal strips that were not the same size.  The painters painted the stripes backwards which is not what we wanted.   They told me if I did not like it they would come back and fix it.  I decided to have them come back and do it the way I originally wanted it.  I asked the supervisor how they would fix it and was told they would sand the stripe lines down and re stripe it the correct way.  When the painter arrived, him and I went over the paint colors and strips.  We were both understanding of what needed to be done.  Half way through the painter went to take a break.  I went to check on the progress and discovered that he in fact DID NOT sand the lines down as stated.  He decided to just paint the whole wall one color and use the same strip lines that were existing.   Which in turn now created the wrong pattern.   It started the light color against the ceiling (which you don't do) instead of the dark color first.  \n\nI ended up paying extra to have that room stripped which didn't even (after 2 attempts and now 6 coats of paint on my wall) get done the correct way and payed full price for their mistakes (plural).  Not to mention the painter made it very clear they he was not happy to be back there correcting their mistake.  After the attempted correction getting messed up again - I just gave up and left it wrong!   It really sucks every time you walk past it to have to look at it messed up!

If you live in Chandler like we do, then you've probably also driven by this place 100 times, patiently waiting for its opening.  Shouldn't be too much longer... as in next week... first week in April.  Cheddar's is on the same plot of land as the former Redfish and Royal Buffett.  However, Cheddar's was smart and had the old building torn down.  They've built a new structure, exactly how they want.  It looks great inside and out; my kids loved the large fish tank.\n\nBeing in training mode, the service was A+.  We had multiple managers stop by asking how everything was and our server was great too.  We had no issues and everyone was friendly.  I so hope they stay this way when they finally open their doors.\n\nWe tried two appetizers: chips & homemade queso and the homemade onion rings.  Five stars for both.  My picky 3 year old actually enjoyed the queso.  My wife and daughter said the onion rings were the best they've ever tried.  Not greasy at all.  I had heard good things about both and they did not disappoint.  If you like onion rings, you must try these for sure.\n\nI tried the baby back ribs and my wife tried the philly cheesesteak.  While I absolutely loved the ribs, my wife said she'd probably skip the philly next time.  She said it wasn't bad, just not one of the better sandwiches she's had.  My ribs were much meatier than similar orders from Chili's or the Outback.  If I ever crave baby back ribs again, I'm going to Cheddar's.  I also had a baked potato (average) and buttered off-the-cob corn (decent).  My boys tried the mac and cheese, which they said was good, but would have preferred without the breadcrumb topping.  Their sides were the apple and yogurt medley, which they thought was the dessert!  My daughter likes a lot of different foods (unlike her picky brothers), so she could have had anything on the kids menu and been fine with it.   I had her try the chicken tenders (which I had also heard good things about).  They are excellent!  I'm not going to lie, I tried a bite, or two, ok maybe three!  They are hand-breaded and clearly one of the best things on the menu.  I know I will be ordering the full size entree in one of my future visits.  Her side was french fries, which were seasoned and cooked perfectly.\n\nAs for prices, take your typical Chili's or Applebee's menu and subtract a dollar or two from everything.  Not a bad deal at all.  When you add in the quality of the food (items being made in-house, etc.), there is no comparison, Cheddar's is the clear-cut winner.  I can already picture this place on a Friday or Saturday evening... good luck trying to get in.  Overall, Cheddar's has great food at good prices.

Ross J's is one of the first Hawaiian restaurants in the Green Valley/Henderson area being around for well over a decade and we've been hooked ever since. They always kept a consistency of amazing tastings foods, huge homestyle portions, and all at a very reasonable price. My favorite is the Chicken Katsu & the Spicy Korean chicken. They also offer some of the best home made chocolate chip & Macadamia nut cookies up by the register(you won't regret taking a bag home). The Staff is always very friendly and again explore the menu they have too many tasty things to list.

Their butter cream is amazing and totally jacks your taste buds in a good way.

To further entice you they have huge amazing cookies for what I believe was only one dollar but I would pay more because they're amazing(always a nice surprise as to what they'll put out). Unfortunately it's clear across town from me though it's well worth the drive. Hopefully they open another location here in Vegas ; )\n\nGreat for Birthdays, Work/Office potlucks, Random acts of kindness, etc. You will not be disappointed and don't say you don't like sweets because I don't like sweets but I LOVE all of Retro's treats I've had to date.", "stars": 5, "cool": 3, "useful": 4, "date": "2010-12-18"}, {"user_id": "OGT0RuphFfjhRWtxjoOjAA", "review_id": "8GP3TWYm9MyRTXmJF4C5gg", "funny": 0, "business_id": "6MokF7uhEV2HF4YLvCqXKQ", "text": "WORST STORE EVER!!\n\nMy daughter had a coupon for $15 off a bra which said \"valid on bras up to $39.50.\" She specifically looked for a bra under that price with the help of a really nice floor assistant named Aurora.

I selected six 12 packs of soda on sale for 3 for $9. When I went to check out, 3 came up on the sale price and 3 were at full price. The manager on duty, Gloria, first asked if I had picked the wrong soda. Then she examined the 50' long aisle and found 3 cards at one end of the aisle (not where all the 3 for 9 signs were posted) that said with additional $25 purchase. I showed her the tag under each and every 12 pack that simply said, 3 for $9 \"When 3 or more are purchased in a single transaction\". She said \"Mmmmm, I wonder why it doesn't say anything about the $25.\" I asked how anyone would know about the condition when the cards were nowhere near the products advertised. She said \"Mmmmm, I wonder why they are down there\". She offered to let me have the 3 for $9 that the cash registered had already authorized and when I asked why not all 6, she copped an attitude, walked around the other side of the aisle back to her office. I asked for the name of her superior and she said her boss was gone. I had to ask a cashier for the name of the general manager, Warlito and the assistant manager, Gayla. I am hoping they will help Gloria with her customer relation skills. It takes a lot to attract a customer, it takes a lot to keep a customer, it doesn't take much to lose a customer, especially when there is an Albertsons and Safeway within 3 miles in either direction.

He ordered a glass of Sangiovese which was described as having a \"big, bold finish\" but was served in a very small white wine glass. I went to the bar and asked for the proper glass. Once the food came, all was forgiven until we asked for our remaining food to be boxed. We ordered more drinks...no boxes brought out. Ordered dessert (got the sampler which was wonderful)...no boxes. Paid our bill...no boxes. Finally flagged down a different server to get them. Of all three courses we had, our actual server only brought out one. It should also be noted that we went on a random Tuesday. It was not overly bust at all.

Surprisingly, there was no pitch for Collision Damage etc. Still, always read what you are being asked to sign-off on. Was on my way in 5 minutes.\n\nWalked downstairs to get to the car. They had a few Impalas to choose from. Couple of them had their back seats still dirty.

They told me it would take about 7 business days and cost 12$. I said fine. Then on Monday the 15th, I noticed no fee had been taken out so I called the bank to follow up. They once again assured me everything had been done on their end, and there would be no charge because the title was actually an electronic one, not paper...and they were just waiting for the DMV in WA to do their part. Weird but fine. Call again on Thursday the 18th...am told by the supervisor Samantha that they had dropped the ball and nothing had been done. Oh AND the process takes 10-15 business days, not 7. I explain to her what I was told and that this NEEDS to happen by tomorrow. She keeps saying sorry and in the end tells me they are overnighting the PAPER title (because now it is not electronic anymore?) and it will be at the DMV tomorrow and she will call me at 9am.\n\n10am Friday morning, no call from Samantha. I call and apparently she is on a break...a very long one since I waited 45 min to talk to her. So I talk to Alex, another supervisor. He tells me they never overnight titles, and it will always take 5 business days (Not 7..or 10/15 anymore). And that it is ELECTRONIC, so it won't be mailed. I ask for his supervisor Melissa. She is apparently busy and cannot talk. Big surprise, I again ask for Samantha and she is still busy. SURE you are. \n\nI ask Alex for my payoff amount and let him know I will be closing my accounts and would like the CEO's number to let him know how his business is running. That number is ridiculous, since it is only a message service and you don't actually talk to someone. \n\nNow I am talking to Juiie in the titles department she lets me know they printed my PAPER TITLE on Wednesday the 18th, and she is confused why they could not fax it to the WA DMV since that is the only thing the DMV needs (Surprisingly the DMV is being super nice and helpful, and they are confused why this bank is so dumb as well)\n\nAs you can see, I have heard so many different stories, and my title proof has STILL not been sent to the WA DMV. \n\nI love the idea of small credit unions instead of the big banks, but now...I can say I am done with AZ Federal.

The kitchen is open and the smell of roasting garlic was wonderful to behold and hopefully a promise of the meal to come.  Sadly this wasn't what we experienced.\n\nDishes ordered included Caesars Salad  for 3 couples for sharing.  When they were delivered, the wait staff hadn't a clue as to how to serve each of the 6 plates to the 6 guests who were to receive them.  The salad consisted of limp wilted lettuce (Iceberg not Romaine?) with barely enough dressing to moisten the sad pile of greens below.  The salad was quite tasteless and a big disappointment.    It certainly was not worth the $10 cost. The bread that accompanied the salad was tasteless as well.  It was perhaps white bread toasted.  The server (or was it his assistant) put some olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the plates in which to dip the bread.  The bread and the balsamic dip were gone in a few moments and never replenished.\n\nBeing a large group the members ordered a variety of entrees and represented a good cross section of menu selections.

Unfortunately, the sauce on the eggplant was anything but plentiful and far from tasty.  There was barely enough to cover the food below.  My wife ordered a dish of bowtie pasta with broccoli.

Our server (I didn't catch her name) promptly sat us and got us drinks without any rush at all.\nWe ordered our food and with her quiche, there was a small side salad.  Now my better half is deathly allergic to vinegar, so she just put it to the side. When our server came to check on us, she asked if everything was okay with the salad, and we told her about the vinegar allergy, and apologized for not mentioning it prior. She asked if she wanted a different salad, but the quickly realized that all the dressings had vinegar in them. So she offered us not only a side of fries, but truffle fries That was very nice of her to offer.\nNot once throughout the meal, did we get an inkling of them wanting to rush us out. In fact, as we were finishing up, we asked for a \"to-go\" cup for her coffee and the gentleman behind the counter offered us fresh cup for the road. Wow! And he even made her a latte instead!\nSo we paid the check and on the way out, the same gentleman behind the counter asked if he could have a minute of our time. After that, of course. I figured it was for a customer comment card or a survey. He asked if we had tried any of their fresh pastries and we nodded no (I think he noticed my better half drooling on the glass pastry display as we walked in and waited to be seated). He pulled out a brown \"to-go\" box and proceeded to explain what each pastry was as he placed them in the box. About half a dozen pastries later, he closed the box, pushed it across the counter and said, \"I hope you enjoy them!\" He introduced himself as Devin and wished us a great rest of our day. A great meal AND some great desserts?!? Double wow!\nThere are lots of great places to eat in this fantastic city of ours.

We decided to check it out on Taco Tuesday and are really glad we did!\n\nThe first thing we noticed was the awesome patio with an open-pit fireplace and oak barrels all around. Very inviting, and I suspect we will find ourselves there often this summer. The interior entrance is expansive and surprising. Straight ahead is a two-level dining room with both intimate tables and long tables suitable for community dining and large parties.

We immediately noticed the intriguing, rare craft beers set along the bar, and the incredibly extensive craft beer list. We learned that they rotate this list monthly and the beers are all-craft, no-crap. Cheers to that!\n\nThe menu has something for everyone, with many local ingredients, and I was thrilled with the multitude of vegetarian options.

The husband had a Spicy Shrimp Taco - perfectly cooked shrimp that popped, with well-balanced flavors and a fresh cilantro finish, and an Asian Chicken Taco which he did not like as much - it may have just been his order, but the orange-soy glaze overpowered everything else. He had also been eyeballing the free-range turkey burger on the menu, and decided to try that as well. It came on a brioche bun and he subbed in some garlicky green beans rather than fries.

Hence, Garlic Festival. One of those things that's basically implied, if you don't love garlic, then don't come. So we challenge participants next year to bring out the garlic.

I thought this was odd, but said ok.    So - I signed the receipt for $50 and $0 tip.  \n\nWhen the charge settled a couple of days later, I found they had changed it from $50 to $58.\n\nWhen I called about this, they said, \"Sometimes the tech realizes later that she made a mistake in charging and we just change the amount.  You must have gotten tips or nail art that she forgot to charge for.\"  I said that I had a basic manicure with no polish, even.  They said, \"Oh, then that's it!

I was pleased to find that it had a large bathroom, but our view was terrible.  We were on the 3rd floor of the Skyrise Tower and had a view of the roof.  Meh, get what you pay for I spose.  The bed was surprisingly comfy, but smelled slightly of cigarettes.  Thanks to the very loud A/C, I didn't get but 2 hours of sleep that night.  Only blew air about 30% of the time and it wasn't even cold air so our room was not only noisy, but muggy the entire night.  We tried turning it off but then it got even hotter so we just dealt with the noise.

They sent a guy to take exact measurements (for a fee) who spent less than 1 minute taking one width measurement, and one height measurement. Then took two weeks to fabricate, which was fine. \nNow come the install...\nNice young man come in and goes to work immediately. 30 minutes later, with the floor tracks installed and the doors hanging, he calls me to tell me there's a problem. The doors aren't hanging/tracking properly. He tells me it's because the floors aren't level, and they cut the doors wrong. He's been on the phone with his boss and says they'll make it right but need to check with manufacturer because he just does the install. I ask him why he didn't use a level when installing the floor track. If he did, and noted it wasn't level, he could have easily let me know THEN that it was an issue. We could have added a few shims to level the floor track, and all would have been good. He has no answer.  I sign the install papers stating I do not accept the work done. He gives me a number to call. \nWe call, speak to a manager, who says he'll check into it and get back to us. \nThree weeks go by, and no call. My wife calls again, gets another manager, who says he'll look into it and get back. Two hours later he has his admin call us who says \"he asked me to call and let you know that it's your fault, not theirs, because your floors aren't level\". Seriously, he has someone else call...\nSo, eight weeks after we order, they charge us to take measurements, they fabricate and then install floor tracks without using a level and hang doors they know don't fit, ...after two calls to resolve, they say \"too bad, so sad!\"  \nI asked for a call from their manager and was told he's conducting an interview but will call you when he's done. That was four days ago,...and no call. \nA bad install followed by bad customer service is not a formula to build loyalty, especially when it would not take much to resolve. Send someone out to reinstall the floor track that has been properly shimmed to level. It could have been resolved quickly and amicably. \nInstead, Home Depot decided on the low road...it not their fault, it's ours. \nSort of makes you wonder if Home Depot is simply \"too big to care\".", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2016-07-16"}, {"user_id": "RKZnUcr9shTEXVnUux3vEw", "review_id": "dpzNRmLvK9QK_Wr2d7wzCg", "funny": 0, "business_id": "NDC3StqRdWu2Z7WMIBVbBg", "text": "Went there for the first time today and had Lilly.

We decided to visit the park for the 1st time on 6/26/16, there was 4 adults and 4 children!  After couple of hours of playing,  the kids got hungry.  I walked over to the fries booth cause that's what the kids wanted. Well I waited in line for 40 min the line was long and it just kept growing. Apparently the fryers  were not working properly. Well if one out of the four employees had any common sense and stock their heads out and said they were not taking orders any more  we all would've went to other booths to get food. So I ask to see a supervisor well she was a waste . I  asked her to  get me a higher person, she did\n Troy walks over and I explained that it's not right to have us all wait so long and can't get food for the kids , he walked us over and comped us  a order of chicken nuggets and fries . We offered to pay but he wouldn't let. We thanked him it was the right thing to do. Kids go back to the Jr section to get on the little rides, we'll the life guard on the the side was just sitting on the edge away from the kids she wouldn't even help them hold the tube. The lifeguard at the bottom is screaming at kids cause they are having a hard time getting out of the tube, and finally I told him if he would just give them a hand they wouldn't be just spinning at the bottom of the slide. He didn't like the idea of putting some effort to help . What a disappointment . Very very vey bad life guards. One life guard was busy socialing with another employee that the kids where walking of the water slide cause the poor little things didn't know what to do.

Even after the third coat it was still not opaque, and it was supposed to be finished.

I assumed she was referring to the shade, which was close to white, not the opacity. After testing out several other colours (each one proving to be just as sheer as the first one) and my nail technician getting increasingly impatient, I gave up and settled for a pure white because none of the pink shades appeared to be opaque. With another layer hastily put on and cured, along with a top coat, the final result was a mess. \n\nThe whole process was uncomfortable and the final result was less than satisfactory. To top it all off, later out I found that the nails were still kind of tacky, as they had not completely dried! Whether it was because they were not cured for long enough, or because of all the layers that had to be put on, I don't know.\n\nAll in all, I really wish I could recommend this place as it's located in a very convenient spot and it's been part of the neighbourhood for years.

I became a patient at this clinic about 5 years ago and before I start mumbling about modern decor and rude or friendly smiles and candies at the front desk let's cut to chase: The MEDICAL TEAM IS OUTSTANDING. \n\nMy family practitioner, Dr. Charles King is truly a genuinely sincere, knowledgeable and  excellent doctor. I never feel rushed. I do feel extremely confident that all records are recorded and organized and there is a great deal of due diligence and  care that the team puts into every appointment, I have to say in general, where on earth do you get to confidentially e-mail your doctor and have a one-on-one response back (always within the same day from my experience!!!??) This is health care with a gold bar raised in my eyes, and this service in particular has me throwing medical accolade-confetti all over the place. \n\nAs for reviews of reception staff being rude, well, I treat people as I would like to be treated. \nI come in on time or a little early, I at most in 5 years, have waited 15 minutes for my apt (this only happened one time) and yes, while it may be a little confusing for some new-comers as to why the ladies at the desk are not handling your cards personally (they are booking apt and taking calls) the automated system to log in is smack dab in front of you and once when I had trouble the lady was polite and helpfully answered my issues logging in.  \n\nI needed counselling outside of my doctors care, and my doctor happily reffered me to services on-site!! I am happy to be starting within a month of inquiring about them! \n\nThere's an on-site pharmacy, easy to get to location right in Liberty Village, and there is green P parking literally across the road. For Toronto, I don't know how much more convenient medical care and access you can get. \n\nFor those interested, they also offer physiotherapy, and there is baby care or something of the sort (sorry not a parent but i know they accommodate people with children there) Also, it is barrier-free design and yes, the design is stunningly modern, clean bright and refreshing. \n\nOk, there, had to chime in after reading such negative reviews! I am a proud fan of the Village Family Health Team and only wish that in the future, they perhaps expand and include more holistic modalities in combination with their traditional practice, as I am forced to go to King Liberty Health Team around the block for naturopathic advice. It would be beneficial to the business to keep customers in one spot, just a suggestion, but space might be an issue unless they acquire the whole building! lol \n\nOverall, LOVE the Village Health team and all the staff, Thank you for providing us with care and appointments on time and on schedule in such a busy hectic city !!

My friend ordered a single egg roll and the spicy peanut thing.  It took us 10 minutes to get to the counter to make that simple order.  Then we sat down and waited.  And waited. 40 MINUTES LATER the egg roll comes after the a cook came out from the back to try to figure out the distribution mess in front of house.  My friend shared the egg roll because we were starving and he is nice - it was luke warm but had good flavor.  7 minutes after that our food comes, literally 47 minutes after I ordered.  I checked the receipt.  We were within a minute of going up for refunds.\nMy dish had sprouts, noodles and chicken.  The ends of the sprouts still had dirt on them, not a lot but they didn't look properly rinsed, like the cooks were rushed??  Or not enough prep time in the morning.  The chicken on this dish is ground chicken, like hamburger, and there were chewy bits like ground up joints or gristle - not edible anyway.  I left 2/3 of the chicken on the plate. My friend's chicken was larger pieces that looked better cooked.  All this for 12.40 including a medium fountain drink.  Really?  I'll go to Farley's where you get a great pizza and drink for 9 (lunch special), or House of Leung where you get good flavor under 7 and table service.  Or jeez, go to Salsarita's, or Zapata's.

You really cannot go wrong, and half of the pizza (the normal size, not the personal size they introduced a month ago) is usually too much food.  What we usually do now is get the spicy salami (...i think it was salami) as an added item on 1 of the pizzas.  I then add sauce and a mix of parmesan and pepper flakes.  My friend doesn't add the sauce.  They also have those little spicy peppers from Italy you can add yourself, I eat 3-4 of these and love it.  But they are spicy, be warned.\nLast time we went they just started offering salads, and the manager just came and gave us 2 salads!  We don't know them, are not in the family, but they are just really nice.  Service here is always super fast, which is what you want at lunch.  I can't usually afford more than 45 minutes or so, including drive time, and this place fits the bill with an 8+ minute drive.\n\nNow this place is authentic, so don't come expecting Dominos or Pizza Hut style pizza.  This is for people who want to enjoy some of the best of Italian ingredients and methods. Of course it is true that Americans are usually disappointed by Italian pizza, I had a typical tourist pie in Rome once (with the anchovy) and was not impressed.  A pizza I had in Perugia was somewhat better, but in general I stuck to pasta the rest of my time on those visits.

I got to talking with the owner (forgot to ask him his name) and his daughter about their pizza, sauce, and future plans. Here are a few highlights:\n\n1. All of their pizza dough and sauce is made in house and is fresh. The pizza dough actually has malt and takes about 36 hours to rise properly. No quick yeast in is place!\n\n2. They plan on having delivery service very soon so check back for updates on their Facebook page, Eat24, or call the store. \n\n3. They also make \"take & bake\" pizza! I have never heard of a family run pizzeria doing this. The instructions for baking are quick and easy. I talked to the owner about baking the pizza on a stone or cast iron and he was was very helpful in explaining how to get the best results and how is dough is never squishy in the middle, it's always crispy. \n\n4. They have a basic menu right now but are open to suggestions from customers about other items to add to the menu, I was personally curious about desserts especially on the Italian side.\n\nProduct review: I didn't order pizza tonight because of previous dinner plans but the owner was nice enough to let me try the cheesy bread with the side of pizza sauce. It was amazing! The sauce was the perfect consistency and had balanced flavor. The cheesy bread is made with whole milk mozzarella and it really made the difference. There wasn't not a bunch of grease or weird stringy cheese. You could also taste a hint of garlic in the cheesy bread.  \n\nI will be ordering pizza from here in the days to come and will be sure to post a review.

The tiny place was just packed, and it was very hard to find a table for 4. Finally one opened up, but it was very uncomfortable because we were so closed to everyone else. I rather be in a place that I can feel comfortable in and lounge and talk without inviting everyone into my conversation. Also since it was our first time trying the place, we all ordered a drink and at least one food item each....which did not all fit onto the table. We had to consolidate all the food items onto just a couple of plates. We basically finished our drinks and food and left because of the crowded atmosphere. And I know most people are probably going to hate me for saying this, but I just don't get why all these people are staying around for hours taking up the few tables there are. Honestly, I don't see how you can study or read in a place like this when it's crowded and there is a guy singing in the front. Maybe in the daytime but not on a Sat night. I wish everyone would be more considerate and study at home or a library and get their drinks/food to go. While I was there, I didn't see too many people reordering so basically you're just taking up room that other patrons need.\n\nAs for the drinks/food, none of us were impressed.

I've always like their food.  I can't remember a bad food experience.  After I write this review, I'll continue to go to Strip.\n\nLet me get straight to my point for this review....the Moscow Mule beverage.  I like this drink.  It's a very unique and refreshing beverage to serve.  But to my dismay last night, my Moscow Mule was not served in the traditional copper mug.  It was served in a glass.  Anybody who's probably ordered one might tell you, it's not a Moscow Mule unless it has the copper mug.  I agree with that statement absolutely!  So when the drink arrived at my table, my server politely told me that they aren't serving in copper mugs because restaurant patrons have stolen these mugs....that's shameful by the way.  I was clearly disappointed, but still accepted the drink, but at the same time told him that they should make it clear to patrons that the drink wouldn't be served in the copper mug, or it should be taken off the menu.  About 10 minutes later, I see another server walking by with a copper mug.  At that time, I stopped her and asked how it was possible I received my drink in a glass, but another patron was getting their drink in a copper mug.  I was told that it was up to the server because they've had so many thefts of the copper mugs.  This was somewhat of a laughable moment and I proceeded to ask myself and then my wife, \"Do I look like a guy that would take the copper mug?\"  \n\nSo for this reason, and to my annoyance, Strip is getting 2 stars.  By the way, I would have gladly conveyed my experience to a manager, had one stopped by to ask how my dining experience was going.

I am new to Toronto, and turned to Google for record appraisals in the area- Kops records was the first to pop up in the search. I checked Yelp for other reviews and liked what I had to read, so I called and reached out to them for assistance. The friendly staff member I spoke to on the phone put me in contact with his colleague, Nick, who has an expertise in this sort of thing. \nNick was kind and professional, and offered to have a look at the records at no cost. I dropped them off at the shop on a Monday and told him no rush, as there were about 35 records in the bunch and I did not want to take away from his time for business, but by Wednesday I had already heard back from him with his thoughts on their value. He offered to have me come back by the shop so that he could go over it with me in person, and was more than patient when I was swarmed with work and it, shamefully, took me two weeks to come back in. \nNick was obviously very thorough, taking the time to examine each record and price it at what he thought was fair. I was pleasantly surprised and so appreciative of this and that he also took the time to clearly explain things to me, someone who is completely new to the subject. \nWhile he did express interest in a few of them, he stressed that I was in no way obligated to sell any to him, that I was free to take them and do as I wished.

My Appointment was at 8:15...\nI arrived at 8:00 and couldn't find the service guy that the online system arbitrarily set up for me. There were five other service reps there that could have helped me as well but my guess is that the pay is commission based. I waited till 8:15 after they paged the guy three times (I understand my appointment was at 8:15 but as you will see, it wouldn't have mattered anyway). The diagnostic was going to be 120ish dollars so I opted to just have the recall part put on...\n\nI scurry off to the waiting room and wait... 75 minutes later the service guy comes in and says \"That part is on back order\" WHY DID IT TAKE 75 MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT THE PART WAS ON BACK ORDER?!?!....His reply was that it had to get into the service bay first to figure that out. Which means my 8:15 appointment didn't get into the bay until 9:30. SO...\n\nHe asked if I wanted them to do a general diagnostic... Since I already killed 1.5 hours waiting, I agreed. 45 minutes later and no sign of the service guy again. I get stir crazy and walk outside looking for the service bays where the Jeep might be loitering. Low and behold my Jeep is parked in the drive up spot where you first pull your car in (Not a service bay).

Well I'm assuming they would have to open the hood to do the 25 point inspection (not just plugging in the diag machine). Well when I got the Jeep back there were no hand prints around the hood, on the hood latch or anywhere near the hood or fenders.

She had Christmas money that was burning a hole in her pocket.  We stopped in and she picked out a sweater, it wasn't on sale, just a simple sweater.  After shopping at different stores within the mall, she found something she liked better and we decided to go back to Forever 21 to return this sweater.  (Here's where it gets ugly) I had used my debit card to make the purchase.  When I checked out,  the cashier asked me \"debit or credit?\"  I told her \"it makes no difference to me, whatever is easiest for you.\" SO... when I tried to return this sweater, she told me it would be store credit only.  WHAT??  Immediately a 20 year old manager stepped in to clear up the situation.  She informed me that they can only offer store credit.  I informed her the purchase was made LESS THAN 2 HOURS AGO.  How about you just cancel the transaction, I asked.  Nope, can't do that either because it was a debit transaction.  I informed her of my previous conversation with HER cashier when given the option of credit or debit, I left it up to her  (duh, debit is cheaper, rule #1 when training a cashier) and now I'M being punished for that?!!  My husband happens to be in the credit card processing business and I KNOW FOR A FACT that a transaction can be cancelled with in a 24 hour period. It has a VISA logo on it, I have rights given to me behind that logo alone.  I tried reason, logic, common sense and was told \"I'm not going to argue with you anymore.\" \n\nSo.  As cheap as you are Forever 21, I am over it.  I will never cross your doorway again.  Nor will my teenaged daughter and considering she's at the mall a considerable amount of time with her friends, I'll take a guess that you've lost all of that business as well.

It was at 630 am: Yoga before work class. First impression: Yoga basically hurt! I dunno why i woke up so early, i have no idea what in the world am i doing, I was very very tight from my cardio endeavors,lifting weights/pumping irons and @ towering 6 feet, I couldn't even barely touch my toes. \n\nI am grateful for the incredible guidance of those skilled and devoted teachers from a diverse set of backgrounds, who have  completed many years of advanced training, including training in mindfulness meditation, power yoga, and yin yoga.  The classes even though they are sometimes hard, it sets my mind to comfort that they are always there with their encouraging voices and support, lending a helping hand to modify the poses.\n\nBut most of all am deeply grateful to ASHLEY, who tend to teach a gentler flowing style of yoga and kirtan. She believed that yoga is quite simply awareness, acceptance, and letting go into love. She made me felt completely natural and accessible not to dwell into my fears and doubts. Her classes made me listen to my body and accept the idea that \"less is more.\"  Its fun to find our weaknesses and not always focus on our strengths. She encourage the students to focus on technique and the \"how\" rather than the \"how much.\" She really honors and accept where each individual's body is, so that true change can happen. The classes are fun and real and that we can all check our ego in at the door and make our practice all about us.\n\nFirst impressions doesn't quite always seems to last. My body and my heart were transformed by yoga in a short amount of time. All of the words and feelings, philosophies and mantras felt like home to me.

Fresh squeezed OJ for the mimosa, a nice surprise. Sampled the cinnamon toast: fresh in-house made rustic bread with nooks and crannies that would make any Thomas' english muffin jealous.

Not too sweet so it may not meet your taste buds if you have conditioned by the the overly sugared American fare.  Toasted just right but the plate was a bit cool, so get to them right away while still warm.  They brought out a plate of cinnamon toast with almonds that was just as tasty.\nSmoked salmon benne style followed as one entree and sausage & egg baguette the other.  A third entree of bacon egg and cheese  with avocado on a soft roll also arrived as a 'mis-order' that we had to try as well.\nThe smoked salmon (in-house smoked) was light, flavorful and cooked before sandwiched between a perfect poached egg (yoke soft but not runny).  Eggs Benedict done exceptionally well.  The plate could have been larger to display this elegant compilation.  \nThe sausage flavor made the baguette, bringing a savory spice to the eggs and peppers, as well as slightly soaking the inner layer of the baguette with juices.  Not like as mightily as say a Mr Beef in Chicago or Luke's here, but enough to grant your senses a pleasant reminder of au jour times.\nAnd while not on the same field as the other plates, the bacon egg & cheese on a soft roll was nicely executed. All the plates came with a side of potatoes delicately fried.  The potatoes were light and clean in taste but perhaps could have been kicked up with red pepper or cajenne to clarify the kosher salt. \nA S'mores latte served as the dessert finish.

At baby Huey's, the wood is not that big, and the bartenders working on the Saturday night I was there were either drunk, high, possibly both, because they clearly didn't give a shit about pushing drinks out. They took their time, socialized amongst themselves, all traits that make a bar look poorly run. I left and definitely won't be going back.

Especially since I frequent this restaurant several times a month. It took around 40 mins for food to arrive. My boyfriend wanted to order a second item and the head cook actually walked by our table and glared at him. Maybe because he's black? I'm suspicious. Around 12PM a rude waitress told us: \"You have to leave.\" No, sorry - we are closing. Just you have to leave? So, we left abs paid our bills but they hassled us to leave even more so no one got change. We all over-tipped by $3-$6 dollars. Once our small group was out we had a waitress chase after us, specifically, my boyfriend saying he never paid in full. Bullshit, considering he fucking over-tipped too because I saw him put over the amount and complained about it. Being a nice guy he paid the waitress more then the difference on the fucking street. Too bad I was walking ahead of our group at the time and only saw the latter part of the transaction. Or else, that waitress would have a bleeding ear from my yammering. \n\nWorst service I've ever had in my life. It doesn't help that the black couple beside us had a similar experience too and they seemed to target the black customers at the time. The whole group was Asian including me.

I called over a month ago to make the reservation and explained the purpose of our visit and asked if they could do anything for us when we came.  We arrived that night and were seated quickly.  Very crowded, very loud.  I didn't remember that from the last visit several years ago until we sat down and it came back to me very quickly.\n\nThe Waiter seemed distracted, but we managed to get our order.  The fried crawfish were great as a starter.  We then decided to get a few more appetizers and one entree to split.  When the gumbo came, we both decided it tasted like spicy water.  There was no flavor at all.  Even the shrimp had no taste.  It almost tasted like it was diluted to make it last the night or had just been sitting in the pot way too long.  I mentioned it to the waiter and he commented that he has never had it and that the main items are made in such large quantities, he didn't expect it would be very good.  What?!  Why would the waiter say that instead of \"I'm sorry sir, can we get you something else?\"\n\nThe rest of the meal was okay.  The Diane had more chicken than anything else (about 2 shrimp and 2 crawfish to go with three chicken breasts).  It lacked any flavor either and was kind of mushy.  The oysters were good and the crawfish scampi was good, but a bit on the greasy side.\n\nThe waiter never asked if we enjoyed our meal and never even said thank you for visiting.  He dropped off the ticket, picked it up and brought it back without saying word.  Customer service is just as important as the food, so that rates 0 stars.  He looked like we were in his way since we were only a 2 topper and he was losing money with us when he had other larger tables in his section.  The manager even walked by us several times and didn't even ask about our meal or acknowledge us.\n\nOverall, we were very disappointed at the experience.  It seems like they are running on their reputation and haven't done much to maintain or improve over the years.  We have eaten here since I arrived in Charlotte in 1996 and have had events there, etc.  This visit will change my mind of a repeat visit.\n\nOh, by the way, no one even mentioned our anniversary when I specifically asked when I made that reservation a month ago.

One stylist actually turned me away because my natural hair intimidated her. I haven't had a haircut since I was a child and I've had anxiety with anyone touching my hair (bad experience from a relaxer at 13 that left me with a bald spot). \n\nI needed a haircut because 1) it was getting too hard for me to manage 2) split ends that was hampering growth and 3) I was going to be on Katie Couric's show. I looked up natural curly salons in Vegas and found Hair Artisans. I called them first and asked how they cut natural hair because that would determine whether they knew what they were doing or not. When Danielle said they cut it dry I immediately felt good about my decision to go ahead and book an appointment. \n\nI came in the following day with the beast unleashed, I felt apprehensive because I didn't want to be turned down again. Rather than feeling intimidated, everyone at the salon were amazed with my hair. To them it was gorgeous, to me it was still a beast. Danielle co-consulted with me while I waited for Arlene who was to cut my hair and discussed what needed to be done with my unshapely, unruly natural hair. She made me feel comfortable and dispelled my worries. To put my hair in perspective, when stretched it reached my waist. Apparently, I have different textures too so the back would be really tightly curly and thick while the front would have bigger curls. I couldn't wear my hair out because it looked like a bird's nest - no shape and it was too long and big. \n\nArlene arrived and immediately got to work. I was just so happy they didn't turn me down. She cut off the \"see-through\" ends and layered my hair to give it shape. She then shampooed, conditioned, and detangled my hair, which I felt so bad for because it's almost like punishment to have to detangle my hair. However, they seemed to enjoy it. Danielle and Arlene tag-teamed during styling showed me the process of shingling which further defined the shape and curls. \n\nI was so happy to see the end result AND to finally be able to wear my hair out. I felt like a D-I-V-A afterward. They recommended products for me to put on my hair, and for a college student, the products were affordable. The whole process was only $40! I couldn't believe it. Of course, I tipped them generously. I'm so grateful to them. I enjoyed my experience and am extremely happy of the outcome.

(for the price) \nIf the rice is properly flavored as sushi rice, it will taste sooo much better.\n\nOur table was close to the sushi chefs (chefs??) and some of them were talking so loudly with each other and with the server girls. They all seem to speak Chinese. \n\nI want to like this place since I think they do a fairly good job offering cheap sushi to the cheap crowd, but as I mentioned, since they don't flavor the rice as it should, their sushi is not tasting like sushi.", "stars": 2, "cool": 0, "useful": 3, "date": "2013-09-10"}, {"user_id": "1gcP2-PSbed9bQoLFrCogQ", "review_id": "XR6Pj8gFTDapaBnJ2DFdig", "funny": 0, "business_id": "M9Y5pCkLFz9RTzPMndo15A", "text": "I have to agree with some of the reviews here.

She took care of the 3 parties surrounding us yet failed to check on us or ask if we were ready to order. I literally had to snag her and request she take our order. I felt so rushed through the process. No small talk, no intro to what the restaurant's specials were, no suggestions-nothing. Very uncomfortable order taking as though we were at an upscale fast food restaurant.\nAs far as the food is concerned- the spinach dip was good, as well as the croissants (that weren't offered).

It is a tapas breakfast still, which at first I was a little skeptical about, but it ended up being great! I had their patatas bravas (Potatoes) and the carne asada breakfast taco. The tacos are like little street tacos, but they were SO good. I also tried one of the Pumpkin Beignets, they look a little bit like donut holes,  they didn't really taste like pumpkin, but they were still a tasty treat. \n\nMost importantly, for brunch they have all you can drink (with a 2 hour limit), mimosas, sangria, and bloody marys. I obviously had to try all of them. The mimosas were very good, I am not a big fan of bloody marys while I'm eating, but besides that it was a very basic bloody mary, still tasty. Their sangria is always good, so no surprise there. I like to get the sparkling white, because I'm not a big wine fan. We definitely stayed the whole two hours. \n\nBesides the food, the service was great! There were about 10 of us so we had a lot of people coming over to help.

It was extremely loud and there wasn't even a band playing (yet). The place was PACKED. I mean packed, back to back, like a can of sardines. It was hard to maneuver oneself to even get up to go to the bathroom. It is a lively atmosphere though, if that is what you are looking for. However this is not a favorable choice to go to when meeting someone's parents for the first time to share a great meal with conversation. We had to yell across the table at one another. Funny stuff.\n\nNow onto the most important part. The \"cuisine:\"\n\nOk, I get it. We live in America where American Italian cuisine is heavily prevalent and this is Vegas so why not mix the two together? Casa Di Amore blends classic Italian American dishes with an old Vegas mob-style vibe to their restaurant. Dishes such as eggplant parmigiana, veal marsala, chicken marsala, baked lasagna, osso buco and the good 'ole spaghetti and meatballs are to be expected. \n\nFrankie, Dino and Sammie would be shaking their heads in disappointment at this place.\n\nWhen a customer sits down to a table, it is expected to have a waitress/waiter greet them  timely and get acquainted with the place. After we all sat down, it took anyone to come over to our table to order drinks, a good 15 minutes before we could order a couple bottles of their house wine. We were not served bread or anything.\n\nI eventually ordered the Eggplant Di Amore. I could not believe how DRY this dish was. It was intensely dry. Being that there was spinach, mushrooms and sundried tomatoes and umm...EGGPLANT...in a tomato sauce? This should not be so dry. As I cut into it, it was like cutting into a brick. \"Where are the mushrooms?..the spinach?...that sundried tomato flavor?...where is it?\" I was excited to try a twist on the classic dish but was severely disappointed. Not only was the eggplant parm dry but it was room temperature, overly salty to compensate for the lack of flavor. All I tasted was mozzarella that seemed like it was sitting there for a while and a solid hunk of nothing.\nMy mother had the Pork Chops With Vinegar & Peppers. She was excited since she grew up with this dish. At first bite, the pork chop was so tough I couldn't tear it off with my teeth from the fork! The weirdest part was that the pork had an extreme fishy taste to it! It was unbearable! \nMy mother's husband ordered a piece of chicken with a potato and veggies on the side...hardly memorable.\nMy sister ordered the Gnocchi Alla Prosciutto, which was one of the better dishes at our table. There was hardly any prosciutto in it and the spinach was \"missing\" again. I don't know if they make their own four cheese sauce but this one was especially bland.\nMy sister's boyfriend ordered the Veal Marsala. Ok I love marsala dishes. I even prepare in my own kitchen from time to time. The veal at Casa Di Amore was overly dry and not the tender suppleness that a great veal dish should be. The marsala sauce tasted nothing like a good marsala wine was used. I was actually disgusted.\nHis mother ordered the same and was greatly disappointed.\nWe also received our bread when we received our entrees! blasphemy!\n\nOn the ride home, we hopped back into the limo. The limo driver was a nice woman but we weren't told that we would share our ride with a couple of other parties. There was absolutely no lighting in that limo so we were neck in neck in the darkness with strangers. We had to wait to go home because the limo driver thought it would be fit to drop those people off first. It was about an hour wait to go home when we only live a couple streets over. The limo is complimentary, but still.\n\nOverall, the food here is not worth a second try.The classic marinara sauce in a place like this should be a signature. It is not here. For the price you are paying, the food is completely not worth it. I can find better quality for half the price, elsewhere. I am at a dismay at the hype of this place, but I suppose it is a good place to go to if your just subconsciously craving a pseudo-Italian American dish at the last minute....desperately. Ya know...that. \"I'm starving, I'll eat anything!!...let's go to 711 and get some nachos,\" mentality. The food was so bland, dry, too salty and their combination of flavors had no flavor at all. I've had a lot better experiences in Vegas with this type of cuisine. (Can I mention Buon Gustos? Thee Best!! Seriously, try it!)\n\nCasa Di Amore needs to be toned down a little. Maybe it's too busy for themselves to handle? Maybe they would put more effort and love into their food and serve fresh food otherwise.

Clean shop. Great atmosphere. Excellent barbers. Great for beards. Online booking system rocks. \n\nI stand by my original comments - Tony and his shop continue to be one of my favorite beard barbers in the Phoenix area. I have seen three of Tony's employee's all have provided a solid haircut and excellent beard trim. Tony, Deya, and Mark are professionals and show obvious care to their trade. \n\nThe shop itself is clean and well lit. The barbers provide an appropriate atmosphere. You can have your normal guy barber talk if that is what you are looking for, however, it is obvious that the barbers are aware when younger clientele are present. In my visits (approximately every 2 - 3 weeks since February) I have not once heard any inappropriate conversations (which you can run into at other shops). \n\nIn addition to the shop, Tony has added an online reservation system. To be honest, I don't know if I will be able to return to a shop that does not have this type of system. The reservation system is easy to use. I can use it when I it is convenient to me (no waiting until the shop is open or rushing to call the shop because I forgot to make an appointment). The hours should fit anyones schedule. I have not seen hours like this for a stand alone barber (not a chain). \n\nBack to the hair and beard. Obviously I have been to the shop. In addition, I trust Tony and his crew with my son's hair. For you gentlemen with a beard, do not fear Tony and his group will take care of your facial accessory. The barbers pay attention to detail. They have great skills when it comes to shaping longer beards. They will give you the haircut you ask for (my son asked for specific \"number\" cuts on his hair at the beginning of summer), but also excel at properly trimming your hair based on explaining what you are looking for in your cut. \n\nOverall I stand by my five star rating. Great staff and shop.", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2016-09-02"}, {"user_id": "bgtM--jaNycgrRXIu-8f8g", "review_id": "5rEQegtikPTz1qOHul47FQ", "funny": 1, "business_id": "xmARZ_MuSfrQCXP4e8RQjg", "text": "FANTASTIC!

The Lettuce Wraps were tasty and the Chicken Risotto was good (very rich).  Not special but good.  Based upon all the great reviews, I was expecting amazing, alas it was not the case.\n\nThe Bad...service was awful.  My normal rule of thumb is that if no one has come to the table within 5 minutes of sitting down I get up and leave...it went well beyond that time this time because I was with a business associate and didn't want to make them uncomfortable.  Here is a tip for those that are behind the bar.  If someone comes up and nicely asks if they know whether they have a waiter or waitress or not, it probably means they have been sitting at a table for a while and no one has been over to see them.  DON'T respond, \"I don't know, you've got to talk to the Host\" and turn away back to your conversation with the other bartender.  DO say \"I don't know, let me see if I can find out\".  Once we did get a server, he continually forgot that we were there, drinks went empty and we had to wave at him to get his attention.\n\nAs far as being called a \"Wine bar\", having a selection that includes one type of each of the normal types of wine (8 in all) does not classify an establishment as a \"Wine Bar\".  This is definitely a misnomer.\n\nThe Ugly...there are better places in the Phoenix area to eat that have much better service.

And we ate at some very expensive and nice restaurants.  Okay I didn't have Mexican food there but in terms of quality and the flavors that are in this food.... Senior Taco For The Win!!!  From the enchiladas to the burritos and tacos everything is bursting with flavor.  The salsas are to die for (especially the roasted chili oil.)  The portions are huge and I almost always finish what I order.  Do you know why...?  Go to senior taco, order anything and you will understand.  This place simply ROCKS!!  OH,  and the Margaritas are pretty good too.  Mucho Bueno!!  I don't hand out 5stars easily.", "stars": 5, "cool": 1, "useful": 1, "date": "2015-09-26"}, {"user_id": "dcWAMo7Pdx-jmA1poFiQzw", "review_id": "adY5SvGIWf9zkVoX5nfQ9A", "funny": 0, "business_id": "SfGZ_idnjXRiSVcoFRZbHg", "text": "This is a review for the Spa.  After having been a Gold Member for 8 months and receiving top notch spa treatments (massage) from one excellent masseuse who is no longer employed there, I had two not so good experiences.  The last massage left me with a bruise (I am 46 yrs old and in good physical shape) and when I spoke with the manager the response was much less than satisfactory.  I elected to discontinue my membership and was told that no refund would be issued for unused treatments that I had already payed for.  This is astonishing given the circumstances!  I have a bruise and am unhappy with the service and their response was to hang up on me!   No apology and no refund... Bad decision.   I thought I was going there to feel better.... \nI will not return to Copperwynd Spa, resort of Restaurant and will not recommend this place to anyone in the future.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 6, "date": "2012-04-28"}, {"user_id": "dcD0zxdpn7KX4poRUSOfwg", "review_id": "JwWnnqyylpDOsxuNz7uY3g", "funny": 0, "business_id": "XRfMD13CXYMF6601gmfrxw", "text": "We really enjoy this place!

I ordered a tuna melt (\"do you want that toasted?\") and potato latkes to go, and then waited for 15 minutes for my food even though the place was completely empty and i think there were 3 staff members there. When they brought my food out the staff member asked me if I'd wanted latkes, and told me he hadn't made them or charged me for them. I said no and left, noticing how small the bag was. When i checked out my food i saw this $9 tuna melt was the size of a standard sandwich you'd make with grocery store sliced bread, and was literally just cheddar on tuna salad. I didn't specify that i wanted stuff on it (lettuce, tomatoes, mayo) so okay I guess that's on me.

Maybe the food is fine. I'll never know because I will never order Vocelli's ever ever again.\n\nAt 8:05pm I ordered a large pineapple pizza from Vocelli's through GrubHub.  At 8:20pm I got a call from the delivery guy, telling me he was outside my house. Weird, right? Can you even make a pizza in 15 minutes, let alone deliver it? When I got back inside, I opened up the box to find a pepperoni pizza that sure looked medium-sized. \n\nSo, I called Vocelli's to let them know I had been given the wrong pizza. They just asked my address, and when I told them they said \"you ordered pepperoni.\" I was 99% sure I had ordered pineapple but I thought it was possible I had checked the pepperoni box by mistake. I looked up my GrubHub receipt while still on the phone, and told her my receipt definitely said pineapple. She insisted, defensively, that hers said pepperoni. She literally was like, \"well my printout says pepperoni, I have proof.\" To be honest, at this point I was just confused since a) obviously something is wrong when a pizza is delivered in 20 minutes and b) even if it was GrubHub's fault, shouldn't they offer me a replacement? and like, you know, apologize? Instead, she asked if I wanted to order another one. Like, to pay for a whole other pizza. I said no, and told her I'm vegetarian so I can't even eat the damn pizza. She didn't really seem to care. She told me, again, that her printout said pepperoni, and that it was GrubHub's fault, not hers, and that I should just call them.\n\nSo, I did. GrubHub called Vocelli's on my behalf and apparently they confessed to the GrubHub customer service rep that they had screwed up the order, and they (finally) offered to make me a new pizza. I'd already ordered another one from a different joint, so GrubHub got me a refund instead.\n\nAnd so that is the story of how I got my $13.95 back and how Vocelli's got a one-star review and my undying hatred.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 2, "date": "2015-03-29"}, {"user_id": "tKZCUeYZisYLHamPwHCrzg", "review_id": "gYCh2IrctPayszlv23ES7A", "funny": 0, "business_id": "94GNGMxmruuqRLRhLqllWw", "text": "Wendy's has always been a \"go to\" food choice for this Yelper, but today was my first bad experience at the Summerlin location.

The place was empty and the hostess tried to usher us to the back of the building to a corner as we admired the gorgeous fireplace and the empty room. We put the brakes on and elected to occupy the best table in the house. We then witnessed a small parade of people refusing to sit in the \"back of the bus\" also. \n\nIt was down hill from there. The waiter had the personality of, well, actually he didn't have one. The service could be described in one word, horrible. We had a groupon to rid our selves of and that's the only reason we didn't casually get up and walk out immediately. We ordered and within two or three minutes, our food arrived. Thankfully the bowls were warm and it was the only item that was warm. The food had very good flavor but the temperature was cool at best. We waited for a moment to see if Mister Personality would at least peek in on us to see if everything was satisfactory. Unfortunately, not to our surprise, he never checked on us the entire cold food meal. Normally, i would have insisted on a manager for some type of explanation but we decided to count our losses and endure it and never, ever return. \n\nConsidering this is a service industry and the waiters depend on tips as a return for excellent service, we wonder how he makes a living. My wife constantly reminds me of how I tip above and beyond 20% even when it's not warranted, but i took pride in giving this waiter exactly what he gave us.  \n\nI can only hope he was having a bad day and we found him in a moment he was not ready for our company. Maybe it was the electric blue shirt i was wearing, maybe? See where this is going? I'm not going there totally but it made us wonder what his issue was with us. Did we fit the \"stereotypical they don't tip\" profile? Well, guess what, we gave him the results it appeared he was looking for.

Was a little apprehensive buying off the net, but it was worth it. When I told him that it would cost me almost $300 airfare to fly down and drive back, he found a local car hauler that delivered the car to my house! Even the loan officer at my credit union said that he was the easiest sales person that she had ever worked with-he was very quick and professional with paperwork, fedex overnighted documents, etc. The car was beautiful and in great shape. Definitely buy from these folks if you see a car online that you want, they make it easy.", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2016-03-03"}, {"user_id": "5dJ4erFp_VqiMyVEuXSALw", "review_id": "HUJsFw3IF6Xe9fiDREmmYQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "3xXU6QBovnxeLSOkrRQI8A", "text": "Top notch pizza!

The air conditioning was insufficient and the room never cooled down. There was even a flyer placed in our room advising us to keep the curtains closed to keep the room cool.

Dents, bubbles, uneven surfaces, awful shadows everywhere.\n- Inaccurate framing. They framed the opening for a closet too small and ended cutting the hollow core door without my consent. They must have free handed it because the cut does not look straight. To make matters worse the bi-fold door does not stay in the track.\nThey framed another door, a pocket door, but the framing is not plumbed, it bows and the door hits when closing. They left without installing the door hardware.\n- The casing was not properly installed, it looks wavy as opposed to flat with the jamb. The mitered corners do not match, there are gaps. They left without finishing all the trim work. \n- They did not replace a window that was within the scope of work. \n\nI even had more work for them (that would have been paid in addition to the initial estimate), but I was left with an unfinished project days before having to move in to my new place.

The beef dumplings taste like frozen dumplings you can buy in Chinatown, The Pad Thai was thick sauce mixed with thin white noodles. Only chicken, no shrimp. The egg was almost nonexistent. We also tried the Thai chicken noodle soup. One word - BLAND. The same chicken they mixed in my pad Thai was the chicken in the soup. Like a cheap imitation of Vietnamese pho. The only thing we enjoyed from the meal was the Thai ice tea. \n\nDefinitely will not be coming back.

I took my 17 year old on Wednesday to get her shots.  She had not had shots for 14 years but I was adopting a new cat and thought I should get them.  I was not warned of any side effects or precautions with older cats and vaccinations.  Hindsight being 20/20, I have since learned that older cats don't even need vaccines and if they have them, should be given one at a time and 3 weeks apart.  My cat was a very high energy, adrenaline rush kitty - completely spastic most of the time!  She was barely 5 pounds but a small framed cat so normal for her height/build.  Upon entering the exam room, I placed the carrier on the table and the vet tech reached in and jerked her out by the nape of the neck.  This is a cat who hides in the corner most of the time and never comes out to meet new people.  She hasn't been out of the house in 8 years, only to move to a new house.  Had not seen the vet in 14 years as I didn't realize some vets will see them without vaccines.  Perfectly healthy cat with absolutely no health problems her entire life.  The vet tech then proceeded to put my cat down and hold her down - NOT a good idea with the Taz Devil that she became.  She had never bitten or clawed at anyone in her 17 years - but she came out Wednesday!  The tech had no idea what to do, threw her on the scales, let her go when she bit her (did not even break the skin), then the cat fell to the floor and landed on her head.  She backed into the corner and growled continually, then hissed when I or anyone else got within 2 feet of her.  We somehow got her back into the cat carrier so that we could talk.  Vet said she could sedate her for her vaccines - I agreed after asking the risks of sedation.  AT NO TIME WAS I INFORMED OF THE VACCINE RISKS UNTIL AFTER GETTING THE DISCHARGE PAPERWORK ONCE THE SHOTS WERE ADMINISTERED.  We left her there and went home, asked for blood work, physical exam, claw clipping, and some matted hair removal.  She had a coat like an Alpaca that would matt once a year - would not let me brush her much and sometimes I got lucky and was able to clip the mattes off.  I picked the baby up about 3 hours later - she was still growling.  The vet said they could not get her sedated enough to do anything other than vaccines....I said thanks, paid my $150 and left.\nReturned home with a groggy kitty, to be expected after sedation and the trauma she endured.   Moved her box downstairs and let her rest.  Noticed Thursday she was having trouble walking, thought it was soreness/stiffness from shots.  Friday she was no better and Saturday I was worried.  I called the vet, could tell they wanted nothing more to do with her after she scared the staff - how do you work with animals all day and you cannot handle a 4 pound 14 ounce cat?  Vet said just to let her rest and that it didn't sound like the vaccines were causing it - to take her in if I thought she should go - well, that's kinda why I called....to ask whether I should bring her in.  After the horribly traumatic episode and stress on Wednesday (for her, not me) - I was not taking her back to that vet.  My normal vet was closed by then and closed Sunday, so I thought I would wait it out.   Sunday she barely walked and I looked up house call vets on the internet - called one to come to the house on Monday.  Kitty had not eaten much since Wednesday but was drinking water and peeing in the box.  We woke up this morning to find her dead in the closet.  Can I blame this on her being 17?  Maybe...but she was a completely healthy, spunky, energetic cat prior to the Banfield visit.  I believe she would have made it at least 5 more years if I hadn't chosen to vaccinate her.\nI realize that Rabies is a state mandated vaccine and I \"had to\" get that one.  But the other shot?  The 5-in-1?  I am writing this so that other adult cat owners KNOW THE RISKS.  If you HAVE to give them shots, then do it one at a time and spread it out over the course of several months.  i ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO YOUR RESEARCH - I cannot believe as much as I research that I didn't!  I should have read and studied prior to going in - BUT I also feel it is a vet's responsibility to inform pet owners of associated risks and I was not notified at all - just that \"sedating a cat has the same risks as sedating a human.\"  AT NO TIME were risks associated with vaccines ever mentioned to me.  Is it Banfield's fault?  Well - perhaps if they had handled my kitten more gently and she had not been dropped on her head...I would not have been so stressed out, neither would the kitty, and we would have been able to sit down, talk, and discuss vaccines.  I was never offered individual vaccines in stages.  I didn't even know what vaccines were being given.  I had no idea what all of these shots and vaccines do to a 17 year old, not even 5 pound kitten when administered as a WHAMMY!\nMy sweet crazy kitty would still be with me tonight instead of the tears down my face.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2017-05-02"}, {"user_id": "Q3vvM4a4ygVfXgq7mxLK5g", "review_id": "lbrVAAkfD_iTkRlFgjcQew", "funny": 0, "business_id": "CoyeXg8FBsS_d20QzNIy-A", "text": "The lavender infused latte is completely off the hook.

Our server perfectly explained the Machaca Beef (and she was right on point), and I also ordered Chicken Adobe.  The beef was SO flavorful and awesome.  The Chicken Adobe I added a bit of mild salsa to it and that was a fantastic idea on my part.     \nLet's talk salsa bar ... for those of you complaining, guess what - Sabor (a Latin American/Mexican style restaurant) has a salsa bar which is often times disgusting since the ice has melted and salsa is floating around the remaining cubes.  At least SouthBound doesn't waste product since the salsa cups are the PERFECT side for a taco!  (And the SouthBound salsa bar ladles are no different than the sauce pumps at Viva Chicken...everyone touches them, just like menus, so wash or Purell your hands!)  \nWe also ordered Street Corn which was freaking awesome!  I seriously wanted to duplicate our entire order and eat it all again that's how great the food was.  We decided to end with an order of the churros ... hello love child of funnel cake and warm doughnuts!  So good!  And yes,  I had an \"On Tap Margarita\" and found it to also be good.  \nHere's the deal, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and everyone has different taste buds and food preferences.  However, for the love of all people involved in what I hope to be an incredibly successful restaurant, GIVE THEM A CHANCE!  Visit on your own, don't just sit behind a keyboard and take the opinion of a stranger over your own.  Sure, wait a few weeks if you'd like, but definitely support the SouthBound crew ... and more than once.  How would you feel if someone met you and hated you and never gave you another chance? You're probably a pretty cool person ... but relationships take time.  If I knew you, the first round of chips & pico would be on me!  Enjoy Yelp people, and good luck SouthBound crew, I wish you luck!", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2017-09-29"}, {"user_id": "jdwfry15emp8t6B6Z6TRXQ", "review_id": "41mhlaVbP3M8ukSaxwDg-Q", "funny": 0, "business_id": "9z_w0YrwHP-_HjtVxQQd4w", "text": "I love this place, it's \"Our Butcher Shop\".

I am sad to say that I have never tasted such horrible satay pho in my life. This is the first time in my life that I have stopped eating after approximately 1/4th of the dish and I never waste food. \nHere is why: \n\n1. The soup didn't taste like anything. The soup was diluted and in a disgusting colour. \n2. The colour. The colour of the soup was the colour of red vinegar (that you can find in most chinese restaurants). I am no expert at Vietnamese foods, but I have never encountered a bowl of satay pho to look like a bowl of fruit punch with pink noodles swimming in it... \n3. The noodles were overcooked also dyed red from the soup! This explains that they were too lazy to boil the noodles separately. Usually the noodles and soup is cooked separately so it doesn't cloud the soup. However, this time, the noodles were dyed pink from the soup.\n\nMaybe this just isn;t their specialty... but please do not torture your customers by sending out dishes you don't know how to cook.\n\nI wish I took a picture of it for you guys.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "date": "2011-07-27"}, {"user_id": "8vByLahzAsULpdXqF3wQPA", "review_id": "Ggc85fhi5l6-cfgxGCcYwQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "Dh2Z3WNu6M71LbMNHEeg3w", "text": "Horrible service, messed up all our orders.

I went to the Eastern location about a month or so ago because I had come down with a cold that very literally became bronchitis overnight.  How do I know you ask?  Well because I'm an adult who has had it about 6 times before.  I know the symptoms, I know the treatment, I know what I need to get back to healthy.  I go thinking that as a quick care it would be, oh, quick-ish.  Ha!  About 10 people who arrived after me were seen before me; I ask the front desk person and she says \"well, we have x-rays back here too\".  Uh, huh.  Fine, after about an hour I get seen by a nurse (I think, she never introduced herself and frankly her broken English wasn't very clear) who takes my vital signs and asks me the reason for my visit.  I tell her.  She asks if I had been having contractions (I was about 30 weeks pregnant) I say yes but that they were braxton hicks and was not of concern.  She sends me back out to lobby to wait for another hour and a half.  Sigh.  Finally I get called back to see the doctor!  Yay!  I sit down and wait for him to come in.  He does and asks why I'm there.  I tell him because I have bronchitis and need to get a breathing treatment and an albuteral inhaler prescription (again, I've been at this rodeo a few times).  He says well if you do have bronchitis I won't give you antibiotics.  I say that's fine because I didn't ask for any.  I know that it's viral not bacterial and that antibiotics are seldom called for (unless you have an uncommon case of bacterial which is unlikely).  So he says well, why don't you let me decide what you have.  Fine, no problem, I wouldn't expect you to just take my word for it.  So as he goes to listen to my chest he says, well, it says here that you're having contractions.  I say, well yes but they're braxton hicks; I'm here because I can't breathe.  So he says well a woman who's 30 weeks pregnant and having contractions should go to the hospital.  At this point, his condescension was so ridiculous I couldn't hold my tongue any longer so I snap back, gee, I thought this was a medical facility; I didn't realize this was no better than a jungle hut in the middle of the Sudan.  So he says, Whatever, I don't like you attitude, I'm just going to exam you BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU ANYMORE.  Excuse me?  Someone failed bedside manner 101 I see.  I demanded he leave as I was not about to let that jerk exam me for anything.  I ended up just walking out and demanding his name: \"Dr.\" Mathison.  I ended up going to the ER where they...bum bum bum...gave me a steroid injection (because at that point I was barely breathing), a breathing treatment, a prescription for albuteral, and a diagnosis of bronchitis!  They also noted that he was unprofessional, wrong, and ended up sending a pregnant woman to the ER to be exposed to needless germs for no reason as he could have done all of those things at the urgent care facility.

I still have 3h 40mins of flight duration. It's a long flight and I was just getting comfy when my inflight entertainment  starts crashing, acting up and being unresponsive. I didn't want to burden anyone so decided to try and deal with the issue by turning the screen off and on again myself. Nothing.. The screen won't even stay turned off after I eventually give up. After 45 mins of trying to play ANYTHING that would work. I brace my self and push the call button on my armrest for assistance. 15 mins later an attendant with a bottle of water walks by. Being an international frequent flyer for over 20 years and having worked in customer service for 4 years; I choose my words carefully when asking for help. \"When you have a moment, could you come help me with the malfunction of the inflight entertainment? I'm really sorry but it seems to have crashed\" \noh ok I'll go reset it \"\n you can reset it? Oh thanks that's great. Thank you so much I appreciate it.\" \n\"Uhu but don't touch the screen when it reboots.\"\n\"No problem I'll happily keep my hands to myself\" \nI sit patiently waiting for the reset. The screen displays a message to confirm the reboot and I almost get exited that i can now watch something. \nBut it didn't work, the buttons unresponsive.\nThe girl comes back and sais \"oh no you can't touch it yet you have to wait for the reboot\". Even though I just watched the screen restart and didn't touch it. She goes on to tell me that I shouldn't have touched it. As she carried on talking over me while I try to tell her I didn't touch it. And if she would just let me speak for a second I would be able to tell her that the screen was malfunctioning before the reboot in a way that was clearly a hardware issue and that I really don't mind that much but it'd be a shame to not inform someone that it probably needed to be fixed because the next passenger would be stuck in the same scenario. She didn't want to listen she didn't want to know she didn't apologise or even seem like she cared. She flippantly offered me another seat but it seemed like a bother for her to offer but also the fact I was in a window seat with 2 sleeping strangers beside me, I really didn't want to be that person to just uproot and move. Maybe I should have. But then I'd be the asshole.. I honestly just tried to bring it to the attention of the crew discreetly and politely with a smile and instead I was treated as if I had complained about something in a way that someone would if they were ripped off. she had way more important things to worry about. I was just trying to be nice. But she looked at me like I peed on her fries! I don't have a sense of self entitlement but I did pay for this ticket and the least I expect is a smile or to at least pretend that you care instead of treating me like I'm keeping you from your responsibility. I get everyone has a bad day but please don't bring your attitude and sass to work when your working in a public facing role. Your representing Canada! I'm afraid it's these little things that just start to snowball up with Air Canada and yet again i find myself disappointed. Im so over it. From the refund policy on flights to the flight credit only lasting 1 year ( I live in Glasgow and there are no air canada flights for me to redeem the credit) and the bad attitude of your stewards I'm just over it and this was the cherry on the cake for me. Steer clear of air canada if your a nice person they're going to make you feel like your an asshole anyway. \n\nMaybe I should have just given them what they came to work prepared for.

We have ordered from Papa Sam's a few times. The customer service is horrible but I could deal with it because the pizza and wings were somewhat decent until last Friday. The first time we ordered from here we could hear them talking in the back. They needed a delivery driver. Someone had \" he doesn't have a license.\" To which someone else replied (sounded like the older gentleman \" do you think I care?\" My husband and I just looked at each other like, are you kidding me??  Then they were out of Pepsi 2 liter. So they were giving customers 4 cans. Well, a 2 liter is certainly does not equal 4 cans. They should've given at least 5 but 6 to be nice and make up for it. Then a lady came in and they told her they were delivering her pizza. She paid for her pizza after stating her father is the only one home and has no money. Then the girl working there said can you call you Father and tell him to tell the driver that you paid for the pizza? Um, shouldn't YOU call YOUR driver and tell him?? So after waiting what seemed like forever we finally get our pizza. We were surprised it was really good. We seriously ordered there then next 2 weekends. So we've had papa sams three weeks in a row. I always noticed that I felt like I was being overcharged a little bit but never really said anything. That was until this past weekend. I placed an order. They told me it was $44 and some change. I asked 'how much was the tax?' They replied back \"$3.57\" I then said \" that can't be\" if my order is 19.99 + 5.99 + 5.99 there is no way my total can be $44. Shes like well this is what the computer says. I'm like OK I order something that was $20 dollars. then 6 x 2 is 12. 20+12 plus 3.57 doesn't equal 44 dollars. Where are you getting this extra money from? She couldn't figure it out so she put her manager on the phone. The ended up doing something and told me my new total was 34 dollars and some change and my order would be ready in 2- 25 minutes. So we get there 27 minutes after I placed my order and guess what we had to wait even longer for our \"pizza\" and I use that term loosely. We get home. Our order is WRONG!! Not only is it wrong it is burnt burnt burnt. I was so tempted to call and tell them but the stupidity that runs through that place frustrates me and so I decided not to call. We couldn't even eat half of the pizza because it was so burnt and hard. Sad they now lost a faithful, loyal customer.  We love Don's across the street but they are a little pricey so we would only eat there every once in a while. Guess we will now be eating there more frequently since  Papa Sams is now a complete joke of a pizza place.

Initially, I was told via the phone operator that I was unable to make a booking due to the fact I had just used an offer at Aria. However, she double checked her accuracy and confirmed that she could make a three night complimentary reservation for me. I arrived at the hotel and due to an event earlier in the day, I did not have a credit card to make the reservation at check in (entirely my fault). I spoke with a front desk agent who informed me that if I was unable to check in on the 25th that he would leave a note in the system moving my reservation forward to 26th-29th...great! As it turned out I was unable to come up with the necessary deposit until 8am the next morning when a friend (M Life Platinum member) laid down the cash and checked in with me. At this point we were told the reservation was cancelled and we couldn't check in due to the fact that I had just used an offer at Aria....at this stage I'm starting to realize NYNY Hotel and Casino has serious communication problems. The lady in VIP services who was phoned by the front desk agent didn't even bother to read the notes that had been logged in the previous night stating that should I not check in the reservation would be moved forward. I instructed her to read all the notes and she then realized her error and proceeded to confirm the reservation. However, without telling me, she instructed the front desk agent to make the reservation from 25th-28th against the instructions in the notes. Furthermore, I was told so many different deposit amounts for check in that I became confused as to how much was required. One time it was $367; another time $300...finally my friend put down $200 cash and they gave us a room after a 30 minute process early on a Saturday morning. \n\nMy buddy who put the cash deposit down had to suddenly depart Las Vegas Saturday evening and wanted his $200 so we went to the front desk and explained the situation and they eventually refunded his deposit. HOWEVER, they didn't explain initially that is was contingent on the room being cancelled until I provided another deposit. I informed the front desk agents that another friend would be arriving within the hour to provide a credit card. At this point the agent said as a courtesy the hotel would allow me a one-time entry into my room and provided a key which would work only once to allow me to grab a few belongings and freshen up. I grabbed the key and took the elevator up to my room and, of course, the key didn't open the door. I returned back to the lobby and explained to the male agent, Robert, who programmed the key, that it didn't work. He went and spoke to the assistant manager, Michelle (unprofessional and horrific communicator), who then came over and said I couldn't access my room because they needed a deposit and that she was unaware I had already been in the room!! WHAT?!?! As a manager, how could she not have looked at my folio and made this mistake. Poor poor poor service NYNY. She wouldn't allow me to access my room to grab a few items. So I waited another half hour...keep in mind this past encounter took at least 30 minutes by the time I was told no!!!\n\nI waited and decided to speak with another manager, Jackie, who was even more unprofessional than the assistant manager. Jackie told me that the only reason I got in the room was because I paid a deposit (is she serious?). Anyway, she gave me a bunch of dud excuses about why they made a mistake and miscommunication on their behalf. Finally, I left in disgust and simply said their service was deplorable. \n\nMy friend arrived an hour later with his credit card and I was able to access my room. I am going to be a nightmare to deal with until the end of my stay as I felt the disrespect they showed me was unlike anything I have ever experienced. \n\nThe two female managers that worked that shift on Saturday January 26 were the worst example of customer service I have seen in the US. Vegas and MGM International most certainly pride themselves on exemplary hospitality and these ladies were not trying to find solutions but rather defending their mistakes. \n\nIf you have other options for a hotel, explore them.

I visited the drive thru this week and wanted to order the Reuben, which is the monthly special. That sandwich didn't appear on the touchscreen menu at the drive-thru so I pushed the button to speak to an employee. The employee told me to enter in a different kind of sandwich and they would know to make the Reuben instead. Well, when I tried to do that -- surprise -- Swiss cheese, which is supposed to come on the Reuben, wasn't listed as an option on the touchscreen because it's not standard. I had the same problem with the special Rye bread not being listed. I hit the button again but the employee didn't respond a second time. I had no idea what was going to come out of that drive-thru window now, but I was pretty sure it wasn't going to be my Reuben. After waiting 30 minutes for the three cars in front of me to get their orders I finally arrived at the window. I honestly believe that, until this very day, the employee, who was the same person I spoke to through the speaker, thought that a Reuben was that dude who beat Clay Aiken on American Idol. But she had no prior knowledge that it was also a sandwich. That was a new concept for her. So there I was at the window and my sandwich wasn't ready, as she had promised it would be. She then took my order on a paper pad like a freaking savage. I requested Swiss cheese, because, hey, it's a Reuben, but she said she didn't have Swiss and that American would have to do--yuck!! I asked for Rye and she said they didn't have Rye. Then, her manager overheard this and told her that in fact they did have Swiss and Rye, so yay me! I then asked this lady, who I assume was employee of the month, to put thousand island dressing on it, because, again, Reuben. Her eyes betrayed a bewilderment that I hadn't seen in a human since my younger brother first saw my mom working out to a Richard Simmons VHS tape in 1987. My gawd. The lady proceeded to close the window in order to, presumably, make my Reuben. I realized that I never told her to put corned beef on my Reuben (obviously, I assumed she knew I didn't want a vegetarian Reuben, but at this point I was losing confidence in this chick's sandwich knowledge faster than a knife fight in a phone booth). So I gently knocked on the window. She tentatively opened the window with a look of dread as if she thought I was the Alex Trebek of Reubens who was going to quiz her about the essential components of any sandwich that would dare wear that moniker. So, I then asked her if she was going to put corned beef on my Reuben and she said, and I quote, \"You think I'm going to serve you a Reuben without corned beef?\" To which I replied, \"Ma'am you wanted to serve me a Reuben with American cheese.\" She retorted, \"The guy in the back makes the sandwiches, he knows how to make a Reuben.\" Me: \"Mmmmmk.\" 10 more minutes passed. She then asked me to pull into a parking space because their sandwich making artist was clearly YouTubing how to make a Reuben and the store's Wi-Fi was acting up. I did as instructed and waited another 10 minutes. FINALLY, Miss Reuben emerged from the Subway Restaurant, Reuben in hand, and presented the finished sandwich to me. I thanked her for her help in facilitating the creation of my Reuben. She returned to the store. I opened the wrapper, fearful of what I might find tucked inside. Alas, soggy Rye bread and no thousand island dripped upon the watery sauerkraut. Hmm, I thought the sandwich artist knew how to make a Reuben. In fact, I was shocked that corned beef appeared on the sandwich at all, but a Reuben without thousand island is just a lunchbox sandwich whose own mother wishes that the only drug store in her small hick town wasn't owned by a crotchety Southern Baptist who refuses to stock copious amounts of Plan B. So, in total, I waited 55 minutes for a soggy, flavorless, sauceless, unloved mess of a sandwich. Total waste.

The entire staff visited my pet daily, and Mandy allowed me to come over twice a day, which helped minimize the stress on my pet prior to travel.\n\nI cannot say enough about how well I was treated, and how nice the entire staff treated both myself, my wife, and our pets.

This is the best second tier hotel on the strip (top tier being the luxurious dens of excess like the Venetian).  I've managed to stay at pretty much every hotel on the strip and the MGM is where I prefer to leave my luggage.  The rooms are modern and well appointed.  The casino is huge.  The selection of restaurants fits all budgets.  There are two big clubs in the hotel (Tabu and Studio 54).  And they have a lion show a few times a day where you can watch two lions interact with trainers and have their pictures taken.  \n\nSure you may be able to find a nicer room on the strip, but you're going to pay much more for it...and you shouldn't be going to Vegas to spend tons of time in your room anyway...\n \nLet's one thing straight from the get go...  People smoke in Vegas casinos.  I hate hearing people complain that the casinos are smokey.  That's like complaining that a bar smells like booze or that your local gym doesn't smell like a flower field.  It's just part of the program and you have to deal with it.\n \nThat said, it is always nice when your room actually gives you some sense of being on vacation.  It can be pretty discouraging staying at a hotel where the rooms are tired or only qualify as a room because they have a bed, a bathroom, and tv.  The basic rooms are very nice with tasteful art on the walls (pictures of movie stars and Vegas icons from the 40's and 50's), plenty of marble in the bathroom, and towels that actually have some thickness to them (I hate those paper thin towels some places give you).  Move up to a Spa Suite and you get a huge room with cavernous bathroom and a spa tub.\n\nI really like the feel of the casino.  It winds on forever and there is no shortage of tables.  The poker room is pretty large too and you will find a variety of players from all over the world in there (not just locals like some rooms).  The kicker is that they have one of those Sigma Derby mechanical horse racing machines over by the sports book.  You pick the horses that will come in first and second and get odds on your quarter bets...fun fun fun.\n\nThe one knock that I have about the MGM is that it is so big, the walk from your room to the pools is a journey.  \n \nOh and beware staying in one of the new towers, otherwise known as The Signature at MGM Grand.  We had some friends stay there during our last visit and it is a lengthy walk to and from the casino floor.  The front desk even mentioned a shuttle service to and from that part of the property, so you know it's out there.\n \nMGM MONEY SAVING TIPS (because we are all cheap bastards at heart):\n \nYou can get a good sized deli sandwich for $7.25 at the Stage Deli over by the sports book and poker room.  They also have hot dogs, soups, and other snacks that won't bruise your wallet too badly.  Grab a quick bite here after your late night carousing, as it is open until 2:00 or 3:00AM on the weekends.\n \nA nice cheap snack - If you go to the food court where the McDonald's and the Nathan's are located, there is a Chinese fast food place on the left side where you can get a \"side\" of chow mein or fried rice for $1.50.  A side is a plate full.  The chow mein is a good snack, as you get noodles and veggies (bean sprouts, onions, and some cabbage).  That could actually be one of the more healthy meals that you have while you are in Vegas.\n \nIf you play slots, you have to join their Players Club.  It is one of those group things, since the MGM is owned by the same company that also owns a host of other hotels on the strip like New York New York, Bellagio, and Mandalay Bay.  Put that card into the machine and take your shot at winning 1,000 nickels.  The benefits are huge, ranging from receiving great room deal (you have to opt in online to get them) to very generous comps.  My wife just likes to play penny and nickel slots, but we always get some kind of great perk.  Call the players club before you check out and ask if you qualified for any comps.  We have gotten one or two nights of our stay comp'd or at the very least all of our food charges comp'd.

I didn't have the money to do it then so I waited a week till I got paid and immediately called David back to order the other 2 tires for the rear and schedule an alignment. I dropped the car off after the tires arrived and David was there to greet me . He gave me a time frame of about an hour and a half so I returned within the allotted timeframe. David let me know after they replaced the rear tires that the camber in the back was no longer negative and I wouldn't need an alignment which was great !! Because I was looking to spend right around $400.00 for the package and instead walked out with only having to pay $200.00.

I learned an extremely expensive lesson at this facility and was never informed by anyone of how expensive it might be. I came to the ER after getting two stings by a scorpian five hours apart. The ER was completely empty when I arrived but even so it took about15 minutes to be seen. When I got into the examination room I was told there was nothing they could do for my pain. I was then asked if I had a current tetanus shot. I knew I was due so I went ahead and got it. Again, never being informed of the expense but I had just paid my $150 copay so I thought that would cover the whole visit. All of this took about 15 minutes. What an expensive 15 minutes it was! I recently got the bill. Here's the cost:\nER Level 2 charge for the 15 minutes =$625\nTetanus vaccine= $257.48\nAdministration of the vaccine= $160\nGrand Total= $1042.48\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, a week later I was billed separately by 303 Emergency Physicians for $704. I thought the doctor was covered under the $625 it cost to walk in the ER.\n\nIn summary, it cost $1,746.48 for a 15 minute visit to the ER to be told there was nothing they could do for pain and to get a shot I could have gotten from the county for free. Beware and stay away from the ER!!!\nI'm not giving the one star for the care I received but for the lack of communication on any level of the fees. I feel like they arbitarily charge anything they wanted and there is no recourse. Who sets these fees anyway? And why isn't the charge for the ER covering the doctor?

The interior decor is also quite eclectic, including some old-fashioned stamped tin ceilings, a step-down front section with large windows, cozy booths, and an assortment of paintings and wall sculptures.\n\nDuring the warmer months, their private fenced-in backyard terrasse is a lush garden oasis, complete with full-size trees, a small waterfall and fish pond. At night, it's gently lit with patio lighting and overhead string lights to give a warm and pleasant atmosphere. On Sundays during the summer, you can often hear the distant sounds of drums from the weekly Tam-Tams on the side of nearby Mount-Royal.\n\nThe bilingual menus are very veg-friendly, with very large and hearty sandwiches made with Santropol's own dark and thickly sliced bread. Many of the selections lean heavily on the cream cheese, so read the menu carefully if it's not one of your favourites. They often have a selection of two soups of the day; on our most recent visit, I choose the Beef & Barley and was quite pleased with it's belly-warming effect on such a chilly winter evening. During the weekdays, you can substitute half of your sandwich for a soup.\n\nOne of my favourite choices is the Minted Ham Sandwich, with ham, cucumbers, thinly sliced apples and sweet mint jelly, served with a light side salad. My dinner companion choose something new for himself, the Mango Madness, with thick cream cheese, sweet and spicy mango and lettuce, with a side salad, which he enjoyed very much.\n\nSantropol offers a nice selection of coffees, teas and other beverages, as well as some delightful milkshakes, available in a multitude of flavours. Their desserts are also quite nice. \n\nSantropol has free WiFi (courtesy of Ile-sans-fils), which makes it a great place to bring your laptop, catch up on email or other web-related work. The wait staff don't rush the customers, which is a refreshing change from some other caf\u00e9s that I've been to in Montreal. You'll often see customers working on their laptops, reading the various local indie papers, writing in their journals or even sketching in their art pads. A lovely way to spend the afternoon, either alone or with friends...\n\nAll told, Santropol is a true Montreal tradition; one that has both ex-pats and locals returning year after year!", "stars": 4, "cool": 1, "useful": 4, "date": "2010-02-23"}, {"user_id": "vC7RGyjJyNUanJ0GS0k8Ng", "review_id": "t0VzyXXf5iHafUBEPFi2pA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "00CfT5fx0fhVbntT83CKsA", "text": "I'm not crazy about AZ on the Rocks.

On the one hand, I'm sure they do great, quality work. On the other,  I believe they have a tendency to charge people for unnecessary repairs. So my 2 star rating is a reflection of my perception of their character, not workmanship. \n\nI took my 04 Cummins here with a broken piston ring, I asked for a ring job. James told me he would tear down the engine and make sure nothing more than the rings are bad, then quote me. He came back a week or so later with a quote for:\n\nNew rings and pistons \nA valve job \nA new cooling system \nNew injectors \nAll new belts and pullys\n\nI asked what was wrong with the head:\n\n\"That's just what we do, so we can guarantee our work\"\n\nI asked :\n\nWell, what's wrong with the head? Burnt or bent valves? Are they not sealing? \n\n\"We haven't checked, it'll cost extra for us to do that \"\n\nWhat about the cooling system? Is it leaking or something? \n\n\"We can check, but that will cost extra. My recommendation is to replace it \"\n\nWhat's wrong with the injectors?\n\n\"They're not delivering enough fuel \"\n\nOK, can you just repair the piston ring  (the only part they bothered to confirm was broken) and put the rest of it back together? \n\n\"Look, I'm not going to have a customer dictate to be what needs to be fixed \"\n\nLong story short, they refused to do any work on my truck  (after they broke the engine down to the block ) unless I allowed them to fix a whole bunch of things that weren't broken.  I had to get my truck out of there with a tow truck and haul it to Diesel Specialist inc. To have it fixed. Even the guys over at diesel specialist didn't know why J & S was trying to extort me into a full engine rebuild other than they wanted money out of me. They went through the heads, they were fine,  the rest of the cylinders were fine, the cooling system was fine; they put the whole thing back together and it's been running like a champ ever since. No compression leaks, no coolant looks, no oil leaks, nothing. That was about 20k miles ago. \n\nI'll update this post after 100k but so far my experience with J & S diesel has left me with the perception that they're extortionist who's primary goal is to put you in a position where you have little choice but to pay them as much money as they can suck out of you. He literally threatened to park my truck around back until I payed for a full rebuild... Fortunately I had the good sense (at least this once) to call a tow and get the hell out of there. \n\nThat being said, the guys over at diesel specialist were consummate professionals who we're not only willing to take in the work but did a great job at a reasonable rate. In fact they were able to save me money by reusing the pistons, which I  originally thought should be replaced. It's refreshing that there are still shops out there that don't feal the need to fix what ain't broke.\n\nTake your truck to the diesel specialist, avoid J & S, that's my advice.", "stars": 2, "cool": 0, "useful": 6, "date": "2015-06-18"}, {"user_id": "vNo6S_AVEs5WeCUWAljImw", "review_id": "IOXlXd4Li2uPbFgOYefgtQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "-Mz3M0g6iFZczs6a7ddf5g", "text": "My favorite meal in Montreal!

So, funny thing is we were on our way to Texas Road house, which is right next door, we turned in the wrong parking lot and decided to give it a try cause we had never been to a Lone Star Steakhouse before, but frequented the Road house back in the Midwest.It seemed their prices were a bit higher, but for a good steak well worth it . I ordered a 8oz sirloin with a baked potato and salad, around $14. I also got a margarita. The waitress was prompt, but seemed maybe fairly new cause she didn't know much about the menu. She forgot our waters and came back with half a loaf of bread and forgot again. The bread was not very good and butter was unspreadable. The bread was cold so it just kind of tore apart. One slice each and we were at the end of it. Our salads came and before I could ask for more bread she was gone. My salad was way over dressed. And because it was a vinaigrette I kept coughing at the abundance. I had to chug my magarita cause no waters yet. They called it a chopped salad and I see why. Like litterly every piece of cucumber was a shaving of skin. Its like they peeled the cucumber into my salad. I even had a  lettuce end in my bowl! I wish I would have picked two sides instead of the salad now. margaritas were ok, not to strong but lacking something. I like that they brought out the glass and shaker so you get a little more in your glass. So it was more like one and a half margaritas. But for $9. So on to the meal. Both steaks we asked cooked medium. They were well done with only a little tiny pink in the center. Not a single drop of  juice on my plate or in my mouth. Dry and tough. I don't usually like to complain at a restaurant unless I really need to. I thought about it, but they would probably offer to recook it and we had plans after. Also I know it's hard to eye a steak with out weighing it, but my husband got the 6oz and I got the 8oz, but his looked bigger than mine.   My husband added on shrimp to his. It came with 8 shrimp on two screws on a bit of rice. He shared with me and the rice was good and so were the shrimp. They were cold though, but they do cool fast. I was just so disappointed that a steak house doesn't know how  cook a steak and their so called seasoning sucked. I could tell the waitress knew we were unhappy cause she avoided us like the plague. I think she over heard us talking about how tough they were. She only came back once to quickly grab our plates and said let me take these for you. Never asked how anything was and returned with the bill just setting it and leaving. She was not a good server. Because of the service, food quality and lack of basic cooking skills we will stick to Texas Road house if we want steak at a decent price.", "stars": 2, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2016-12-10"}, {"user_id": "I9IqqJYtRsamLZ8S_yewCA", "review_id": "dszQ3yajJMDlVE2tKyt1iA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "NUT7tou1Uvjh0GB4I41Qig", "text": "I stopped in for lunch one afternoon and found they had some great lunch special.

If you like rude bartenders who ignore you and three olives is your go to brand this place is for you. We were looking for a chill place to watch some live music and this place came up. I checked the place out online and yelp reviews and decided the place seemed like a cool spot. Originally from Wisconsin where we have the most bars on one street I have been to my share of taverns, some pretty dirty, hole in the wall places. So I wasn't detered by some reviews saying it's dirty and a really punk environment. Some of the best bands and service can be found at these little filthy drinking holes. However, our experience here was dreadful. We walk in around 8ish the time the band is suppose to start to a pretty dead place with only 2 patrons. Understandable, most people don't head out til later hours. The lady bar tender was friendly, but dumb as a box of rocks.  She noticed our out of state id's and starts up a conversation. And the scam begins. First, they only had a sip of crown royal left so she offered up an off brand I never heard of. Sure my husband said he would try it. So I order southern on the rocks and she asks whats that. Southern comfort...yah know. She looks around for 5 mins and says we don't carry it. Second choice...ok so do you have Bacardi silver, no, ok ...Smirnoff...no. What's that I spot a bottle of crown royal vanilla, I guess I have that. Why she didn't offer this to my husband when the crown ran out is beyond me. Anyways we start a tab thinking nothing of it, we do this a lot and never had a problem, plus it's advertised all over cheap drinks. So the band plays and they are pretty darn good. Next bar tender shows up for shift change and his attitude is to totally ignore us. You can tell this is the locals joint and they like to keep it that way. Everyone that showed up were kind of rude and just a bad vibe. I have been in the area for over 6 months and been to several taverns and this is the first time I experienced this. Most places were friendly and great service. So my drink is gone and I slide it to the front of bar. The bar tender doesn't acknowledge it or me at all. He is constantly disapearing in back for long periods of time. A bad odor permeated from behind the bar like old dirty dog and Dorito feet. Two people who ordered bloody Mary's spit it back in the cup cause it tasted bad. Bartender brought out several 6 packs from back and puts on ice in cooler. He then brings out, guess what, a new bottle of crown royal. So the place gets busy and band is rocking. But atmosphere still sucks. Dirty glares from most people there and they starting dancing crazy blocking the view of the band. So it's only 10 and we decide to bounce cause we just aren't having a good time. Cash out says its $41 ! For four drinks, in plastic cups. That's worse than airport prices. Cheap drinks?? This is the most I've paid anywhere, even in ritzy parts it wasn't that much for the same drinks. Totally think the girl was scamming us and skimming off the top. How do you even total up to 41 on four exactly the same drinks. Their system is to write it down on a scratch paper to ring it up.Especially cause our id's said we were from out of town and not local to their bar I think she thought she would get away with it. We defiantly got robbed here.  We reluctantly paid the money and left just pissed and disappointed. After I told some people I went there they were like oh...were you looking to get stabbed? Its a weird sketchy area over there. Wish I would have known earlier. Band was pretty awesome on good note. Will never be back!!

Had a sweet and smoky ketchup based sauce, mustard, and spicy vinegar so you had options for topping your meat which is a bonus. However, nothing could resurrect the meat. Very watered down tasting. In fact it had very little flavor at all and no matter how much sauce I added I couldn't get it down. My wife and I threw both our plates away mid meal and got some pizza on the way home.

You cannot see their restaurant sign at all during night time. It is not even lit up and font is small. First thing you notice upon entering is that the restaurant decor is quite unique as it is Victorian style and you can see that it is a high end restaurant. HOWEVER, many of the regular Chinese restaurants are far better than this one. \n\nA 5 cm ROCK was found in my E-mein noodles!!! 5 cm!! How the hell did it get in there? No one knows. The waiter said it might have fallen from the ceiling!!! That is just disgusting and I am lucky that I saw it before it went into my mouth. No manager or chef came to apologize. Waiter just said he gave it to the manager to investigate. More like throw it out and pretend nothing happened!! Asked to speak to the manager or chef but they just ignored my request!! Did not replace the dish either. \n\nFood portion was small but expensive! The abalone was quite hard as well.....! Once I got home, I felt really thirsty.... Lots of MSG! \n\nThe service was bad. We had 12 people at our table but they only served us 11 plates and only realizing their mistake after serving. We let the first time go, but it happened again twice after! They told us they will grab another portion from the other table....... Pretty pathetic. \n\nWhen we sat down, the waiter told us not to shift our chairs as it would mess up their placing on the table. Why do we need to adjust to the setting on the table... We should be able to sit comfortably! Some people just like to have more space. Plain nonsense! \n\nWill NEVER go to this restaurant again nor recommend it to anyone. All the restaurant has is the looks. You are definitely not getting what you paid for. The food is really average but they charge you double the price! I'm not sure how a PIECE OF ROCK ended up in my noodles and quite amused that no one noticed it nor acknowledge their fault.

I was admitted to the ER with sever pain in the abdomen. I suspected (and was right) that I had gallstones. The Doctor would not listen to my understanding of what was happening inside MY body. He ran every test except an ultrasound for gallstones. All tests came back normal. He then ran an ultrasound and surprise of all surprises, gallstones. The doctor then admitted me for surgery. I advised that I was not ready for surgery and wanted a second opinion. The doctor said that if I left and went for a second opinion, my leaving would be Against Medical Advise (AMA) and this would result in my being personally responsible for the cost of testing and any other cost incurred at the ER, as my insurance would not pay for my ER visit. Basically, I felt that I was being financially blackmailed. I contacted my insurance carrier and they advised that this was not the case. I was told that a hospitalist would come and see me and discuss my options. NO hospitalist saw me. A surgeon did see me and advised that if I did not have the surgery right now, \" You can never come back to this hospital again\" Upon hearing this statement I asked what policy he was referring to and why? I was then told, by the Surgeon that I would not be allowed back because it was \"not fair to him\". The principal of his statement was predicated on the idea that if I did come back, I would be in worse shape and that His job would be more difficult. I refused all further treatment, demanded that NO AMA be issues and requested immediate release. All of which was granted. I left Banner desert and made a beeline for Dignity health at ST Josephs Hospital. At St Joe's I was treated, by doctors who welcomed second opinions, did not blackmail me into rush surgery and offered their services again and again if I needed them. I worked with their system of doctors and will have my surgery, with a team of doctors who I trust, only 3 days after leaving Banner. My advise is to get to a Dignity Hospital if you can, not a Banner Hospital.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "date": "2017-07-27"}, {"user_id": "l5KsXibEX1uEjqais-fsZA", "review_id": "n8SmlSCW8-dKHbKAuK0EUw", "funny": 1, "business_id": "-2ToCaDFpTNmmg3QFzxcWg", "text": "Stay away. $10 from airport but we stood in the heat for almost 45 minutes while no one could locate the shuttle.

I called a couple of dentists and they all say the dentists will determine which cleaning I need either regular or deep cleaning. Only this office said I can have the regular cleaning on the same date with the examinaton and x rays. i particularly emphasized I just needed the regular cleaning which the receptist said I can have it. So I went here. They gave me the x ray and the examination but not the regular cleaning. The reason is the regular cleaning will worsen my teeth because the particles will drop into the pocket during the treatment. I complained about the message received over  the phone. The receptionist started to deny what she said to me. I am not sure it's the state dentist board set up the rule for all the AZ dentists if people require the deep cleaning and then they can not have the regular cleaning before any deep cleaning treatment.

Went there with a girl last Friday night when Calvin Harris was spinning. Got there around 9:45pm & the line extended from the entrance to outside the nearest exterior door. Entrance to Omnia is the same location as the old Pure. Line got ridiculously long but at 10pm they started letting lots of people in and quickly. Only had to wait +-15 minutes. They usher you upstairs to the Terrace which overlooks the strip, similar to the old Pure. Very scenic & a nice option to take a breather away from the inside. The interior is dope! Tiered bottle service seating around the main dance floor. There is a bar in back of the DJ table & surprisingly it was rather easy to get drinks promptly. Expect $15 beers & $20 mixed drinks (or close to). They have a fun hip hop room located down a flight of stairs. Cool vibe & probably less people do you can actually dance. DJ was meh, played a ton of Pittbull... Like nonstop Pitbull. I like Pitbull but the DJ musta been related or a stalker. The main Chandelier  on the main floor is spectacular! The clubs interior finishes are upscale, better than Hakkassan or Marquee. You'll have a tough time dancing on the main floor in front of the DJ table unless you post up there at 10:30 & wait 4 hours. Calvin was terrible & we actually left early. Came on at 2:30pm & didn't even play his own songs / when he did, he poorly mixed them. Get yo sets right bruh, just play your hits uninterrupted. \n\nIn conclusion, Omnia is cool & definitely worth a visit, but XS still reigns supreme.", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "date": "2015-06-20"}, {"user_id": "RyHnzR_c4AnCExnqnme2UQ", "review_id": "WX5iyiVqrEsOYjxQfmXcDw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "0Rni7ocMC_Lg2UH0lDeKMQ", "text": "Barros actually has some of my favorite pizza but I won't order from this location again.

Very well.\n \nI met up for a New Year's Eve lunch with friends to sample the wares at this tiny spot that's been getting all kinds of great buzz. I won't speak for the other ladies, but I for one can assure you, you can believe the hype.\n\nThese porcine bundles of joy are sandwiched between soft and crusty sourdough buns from Portuguese bakery, Caldense. At $5.95 for the basic sandwich, it's a healthy size for most. Seriously guys, the pork. It is juicy, packed with flavour, most notably a lovely garlic note from the marinade, and is studded with the most delightfully crispy bits of skin I've encountered in a while. I ordered the sandwich with mushrooms, but would love to try it with the mild bitterness of rapini next time.\n\nWhile the star at Porchetta & Co. is obviously the sandwich, you can also partake in a side of soup or roasted potatoes. If you're feeling extra hungry, swear to god, have the potatoes. The only time I've ever encountered a mouthful like them, is what is referred to by select members of my family and friends as \"the potatoes\". One year, I roasted my bird \u00e0 la Martha Stewart, basted in wine and butter, and placed halved new potatoes under the roasting rack to absorb and cook in the buttery, winey drippings. P&C's potatoes come close to these.\n\nSimply seasoned in salt, pepper and olive oil, the spuds are roasted until golden and simultaneously crispy and fluffy. Potato perfection. I said \"Why not?\" to the offer of truffle sauce to go with them, and would recommend this dressing in a heartbeat. All the flavours in each dish danced together like Bolshoi on my tongue, each performing their role perfectly to make my mouth happy.\n\nPorchetta & Co. are located at 825 Dundas St. W, and are open Tues.-Sat. 11:00am-9:00pm; Sun. 11:00am-4:00pm; closed Mondays.

He told me that this is a way that dentists bring in a lot of money.

In the end I was allowed into the ultrasound room, which was an incredible experience.

It was a different ultrasound tech the second time, but again experienced wonderful service.\n\nHad all 150+ photos from the ultrasound emailed to us two days later which was great. It was $6 for the service but well worth it, despite being unsure what I was looking at for 90% of them.\n\nAnyways, apologies for the initial review. The staff certainly made up for the initial wait.\n\n\nOriginal review (1 star):\n\nHad an ultrasound appointment scheduled over a month in advance and then was told with less than 24hrs notice that they needed to reschedule. I had already booked time off from work and made arrangements with colleagues, but oh well - things come up and I can understand that.\n\nHowever, now I'm waiting in the office and it's been over an hour since my appointment was rescheduled to be. I've been told that as the father I would not be allowed in with my wife for the ultrasound, and all round have been given no updates or indications on when she'll actually be able to go in. \n\nPregnant wife is now needing to go to the washroom, but because the ultrasound requires a full bladder she's not supposed to. \n\nUgh. Anyways, maybe not a true representation of the clinic, but my experience so far has been awful and it doesn't seem to be getting better.\n\nSource:\nA frustrated father to be who works in healthcare at UHN (Toronto General Hospital)", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "date": "2016-12-08"}, {"user_id": "4EqVzE35BxQOudwzrpGAXA", "review_id": "erSx539feRmLS80GxxeVeA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "2B4bC4w4PDC8Pj53SfTG2g", "text": "Really the food tastes like home cooking..price s also reasonable and love it.hope to see the restaurant to add more menus in the future", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "date": "2017-11-26"}, {"user_id": "IG_kyY2iXOuJhpOtXYt9VA", "review_id": "eWL-17-am6Il-7TW9cEUHA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "Ljkz7jHZKpe_DhWVHAtbTg", "text": "Best burger I've had in a while.

As I waited for the numbing agent to take effect, we chose the right ink to match my hair color and she even added a little \"warmth\" of another shade to be more precise.  She took the next two hours forming, checking, forming, rechecking, forming, getting another tool for the right size she needed, rechecking.  And then she asked me to see where I thought changes needed to be made.  Needless to say, Tia is perfectionistic and that is a mighty good trait to have in your aesthetician/cosmetician (or whatever they call it these days) especially since their procedures involve permanent changes on the face that you will look at every single day in the mirror.  Through this experience, I was very pleased to learn that professionalism, friendliness and making the extra effort to do a great job are not things of the past nor distinct from each other.  My brows are finally a month old and look wonderful.  I will be returning to have them touched up by Tia, of course, and HIGHLY recommend her to anyone desiring an awesome artist and outcome for permanent cosmetics.

The Tuesday the young guys arrived and they were diligent and courteous and packed up and loaded my one bedroom in about 2 hours. They do not take as many precautions with the items as other moving companies in my experience such as covering large furniture with blankets to avoid nicks and scratches, covering mattresses, putting flat screens in tv boxes and taping down all drawers to prevent sliding. At the end of the loading I signed the receipt/contract showing with the hourly rate of $110, and the extra supplies a cost of $480 was applied to my deposit. I was given a copy of the contract which included an inventory of everything packed\n\nWhen they arrived on Friday to unload they presented me with our receipt/contract of the move but this time it was covered in whiteout and various parts had been crossed out. I retained my original copy of our contract with our signatures which showed the original quote and charges. They seemed to have no problem altering a legal contract and did not acknowledge the unprofessional nature of this behavior. This new altered contract showed instead of the $220 surplus I had from Tuesday totaling $480 I had a $15 balance that I now owed, and the cost for Tuesday's move was actually $715. I now owed them $515 cash up front for them to unload my small bedroom worth of items. \n\nWhen I called about this dramatic change of the cost of my move going from $700 to $1200 I was told they made a mistake and forgot to charge me for some additional expenses. They never called to tell me in advance about the error or even apologize. Instead they threatened to leave with all my possessions unless I paid them the additional $500 in advance. They actually did leave at one point but I called and begged them to return. Since they do not accept credit cards I quickly rushed to the grocery store to get them the cashiers checks. They unloaded my small apartment in 2 hours which included the time for me running to get the cashiers check while they waited, and them leaving and coming back. So it cost me $1200 for them to pack move and unload in about 3 and one half hours. \n\nThe sad thing is that they may have squeezed a few extra hundred dollars out of me for me to finish the move under duress but I have many young professional coworkers that are transient and, if I had a positive experience, would have been happy to recommend them like I have done for other moving companies.

Nevertheless I did get a Man About Town and it was stiff and tasty. Here's what food we ordered:\n\n- Pork buns - pretty awesome with peameal and yolk. Breakfast in a bun!\n- Rice Cakes - OMG. These were like rice gnocchi in an asian tomato sauce. Incredible texture and flavor on these.\n- Wild Rice - least favorite dish. I found it quite salty for my palette.\n- Grits - Matt Blondin used to make the best grits at Acadia. These were amazing!\n- Apple and Bacon Salad - This dish really worked. Amazing idea, amazing presentation, great flavor profile.\n- Cabbage - we got this on a limb and this was actually my favorite dish. They turned one of the most boring vegetables into something truly amazing. The edges of the leaves were slightly charred, that's all I can really tell you--I have no idea what else was in it but everyone at my table couldn't believe they were eating cabbage.\n- Hangar Steak - served with bibb lettuce leaves and condiments so you could make your own lettuce wraps. A solid protein plate.\n- Chicken - excellent presentation but the flavor left a little to be desired.\n- Chocolate - we go the chocolate for dessert. It's like a mousse with some ganache and the chocolate was imported from france. I haven't tasted chocolate like this before.\n\nThe final damage was $100pp tip in.

There are five throughout the U.S. - New York, Miami, Las Vegas (in the Cosmopolitan), Toronto, and Beverly Hills. I first heard about Scarpetta from my boyfriend's sister, as we both like to watch Conant on Chopped on the Food Network. \n\nWe started the night off with two cocktails - Scarselli and Dolce Limone. Good, as always. They gave us complimentary bread: sourdough, french, rosemary, and a stromboli. Along with the bread were marscapone butter, eggplant and tomato-herb spread, and a citrus-infused olive oil. The stromboli was definitely the best, but the eggplant/tomato-herb spread was really good. As our appetizer, we chose the Tuna 'Susci' ($16), which as you can see is raw tuna wrapped around vegetables. The tart-marinated vegetables complimented the fresh tuna very well.\n\nAfter reading so many good things about the spaghetti, I had to find out if this is really the best pasta you will ever have. Usually, I am disappointed with certain dishes because people have hyped them up way too much. But for once, the spaghetti ($24) lived up to its hype. Wow, I honestly can't believe spaghetti could taste this good. The pasta is cooked to perfection - consistency, texture, taste - everything was on point. Then there's the sauce, ahhhhh. You can taste the fresh tomatos and the basil in every single bite. I am speechless, really.\n\nAlthough the spaghetti was definitely the highlight of the night, the duck and foie gras ravioli ($25) comes pretty close. Once again, the ravioli was cooked perfectly (as expected). But what really made this dish stand out was the filling. Duck - check. Foie Gras - check. Can you ask for anything more? Two of some of my favorite things to eat are mixed together and stuffed into a ravioli. It is the right amount of duck and the right amount of foie gras - not overpowering at all. The marsala reduction adds a nice and clean finishing touch to this already, perfect dish.\n\nAs for dessert, we opted for the chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. The cake was just like every other molten chocolate cake, but the toasted almond gelato and the salted caramel sauce was goooooood. I wouldn't order it again, only because I would want to try their other desserts.\n\nFor two cocktails, a beer, an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert, our bill came out to be about $125. Not that bad considering all the food and drinks we got. The entrees may seem pricey (especially the spaghetti), but you actually get a good amount in one order. When I come back (hopefully soon), I would definitely get the spaghetti again. Everything else, I would switch out only so I can try other items on their menu. But if it is your first time going, I highly recommend the spaghetti and the ravioli.

There was 1 girl at the front who was taking care of another customer. No problem, I can wait. Upon waiting for a few more minutes an elderly man approached the counter and cut in front of me in order to pay his bill. I didn't say anything to him as he was elderly & I'm patient. Of course, the cashier didn't even bother to say that I was first (no big, i suppose) & proceeded to check him out. She was having difficulty with his coupons & requested assistance from an employee named Ashley. Ashley was extremely rude and angry. She told the cashier she couldn't help her, rolled her eyes at the elderly man and slammed the cash register shut doing something else. She stormed off saying \"I can't help you right now\" in an angry tone. She went over to the other side of the restaurant to where she very OBVIOUSLY was gossiping about the elderly man to another waitress as they both looked around the corner in disgust. The cashier apologized to the elderly man on behalf of her rude coworker, \"Sorry, she just has a lot of things to do.\". UM NO? Don't make excuses for her. Her attitude was unacceptable. \n\nEventually, a manager assisted the cashier with the mans coupons and I was next. Or so, I thought. Another employee handed the cashier the phone & told her to take the order. She looked at me, knowing I was next, and said \"I know you let that older man go in front of you, but I am going to have to take this phone order. I can't keep them waiting.\"  WHAT?! Um okay?? So that is TWO people that steak and shake decided are more important than me? As the cashier was taking the phone order, yet another employee approached the second register. Finally! I would get to order... right?? NOPE. Another customer was standing next to me & she asked him to come forward. WHAT seriously? Eventually, as THREE customers were served before me.... I could finally place my order. And I did so, without problem. 10 minutes later, my order arrived & was ready to take home. By this time, it was 6:15.

I have had positive experiences with the Oliver and Bonacini brand, but this visit left me underwhelmed.   \n\nThe dining room was massive, formal, and more than half empty at 1.30 PM on a Saturday. We were seated in the \"lounge,\" which promised to be a warmer, more intimate room. The industrial-style concrete and the bare Edison bulbs clashed with the kitchy library-book wall-paper, and a number of tables were randomly scattered around and unusable. We sat next to a dance floor (or was it a wine and cheese mingling area?) left over from the room's previous incarnation. \n\nThe service was first-class. Well done, team (I phoned in a reservation, and was eagerly attended to throughout the visit). \n\nThe menu looked intriguing and the prices not unreasonable. Unfortunately the food was a disappointment. In my O&B breakfast, my eggs were cooked over hard (not over easy as I had asked), and were served over a thick film of white oil. Potatoes were sub-par and salty. I had been enticed by the promise of a cheddar scone, but that too was a letdown when it turned up dry and bland on my oil-drenched plate. The server was kind and agreed to replace the meat in my dish with market vegetables (anything but meat would do, I had begged). The menu warns that no substitutions are possible, but that would have made waffles the sole option for veg-friendly patrons. Alas, the vegetables were drenched in butter and salt. My partner's eggs Benedict was not much to brag about either. The eggs were expertly poached, but they were served straight on a bare, dry scone. The kitchen did not offer to replace his ham (which he also asked to skip) with even a lonely leaf of spinach.\n\nI'd return if the food improves.

I found Cielo on yelp and decided to give them a try since they have great ratings. After searching on pinterest, I found a hairstyle/color that I wanted to try. When I went in for my appointment I was excited to see that my hairstylist had the exact same cut/color I was looking for. That day was just for my haircut because I wasn't sure if i wanted to go through with the color until I found out exactly how much it would cost. The color I wanted to do was black at the top, purple middle, and silver bottom. When I asked how much it would be, she told me it would be $120 since my hair is short (I had an A-line cut above my shoulders). I thought that was a really good deal since I was told it would take several bleaching processes to get it light enough to do the color I wanted. So I made an appointment that day and a couple days later had my hair bleached. I paid the $150 ($120 for service plus 25% tip) and thought  \"okay, I guess I make the whole payment upfront.\" A week later when I came in to bleach my hair again, she was confused and asked what I came in for... After I explained that I came back to continue the coloring process for my hair, she told me that I would have to pay another $120 because each bleaching process is $120. Then it was my turn to be confused because now she's saying something different than before. So if it was $120 each time I was going to get my hair bleached, by the time I got the color I wanted it would be $400+ which I would never have even agreed to do. I felt so cheated and really upset because she made it seem like it was a misunderstanding. That first day I came in, I asked how much it would be to do the color I showed her on my phone. I didn't ask how much each bleaching process would be because I don't care about that. I only care about the final cost to get my hair that color. The way she was acting like she didn't know why I came in that day made it even more clear something shady was going on.. I had my hair bleached in order to get my hair closer to the color that I wanted. Did she think I changed my mind after getting my hair bleached?? If I knew it was $120 for bleaching my hair once, I would never have done it.. That is just ridiculous. My hair didn't even reach my shoulders and she only bleached the bottom half of it. Now I'm out $150 and left with a hair color that I don't care for. I really hope nothing like this happens to anyone else, my advice is if you are getting your hair colored and it takes a couple appointments, make sure you get the exact price in writing so you have proof later when they try to change it. The chase credit card I used has purchase protection so hopefully they will be able to get my money back.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 3, "date": "2017-05-28"}, {"user_id": "U5SRkKP6-OVx9UiF5C0jBQ", "review_id": "9E15aj6e-ivdDD3DjJjVgw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "ak8jNpxG97WHdNhPAUWrOQ", "text": "Hands down best lulu store in Toronto.

I chose Valley Spinal because of some information on their website.  They looked really great.  So here's the lowdown:\n\nThe good: they are young, solid chiropractors.  Since they recently graduated (have been in practice 3 - 4 years), they have the most up-to-date training.  In addition, they try to create a fun environment with contests and emails.  Some of it is silly, but if you like that kind of stuff, it's a pro.  I can take it or leave it.  You get a \"free\" set of X-rays that you are allowed to take with you if you choose to leave their practice.  Finally, if you need a lot of chiropractic work (due to an accident or chronic issue), they have a pricing plan that allows for reduced rating. (See ugly.)\n\nThe bad: They are a one-trick pony.  They are fine chiropractors, but little else.  I personally prefer someone who has a greater knowledge base (nutrition, massage, acupuncture, supplements, alternative therapies, etc.).  Also, because of their limited time in practice, they have A LOT to learn about relating to customers and treatment.  Each session, they put up your X-rays (good thing), but they go through the motions of counting which vertebrae, etc. and perform a lot of the same corrections every time.  I like a chiropractor who feels his/her way to what needs to be done with my body.  \n\nThe ugly: Every time i left their office, within 24 hours, I would have a new pain I hadn't had before.  You could chalk this up to the fact that our bodies react to being adjusted into a correct alignment.  But my pain was typically an issue unrelated bone alignment (e.g., muscle strain in my neck).  They are also very secretive about their pricing.  The reception staff doesn't share this information and the chiropractors themselves aren't in agreement.   So, here's the deal: individual visits are $60 each.  (That's really high - they claim some state law that requires this, but I haven't found a chiropractor in the area that charges that much.)   If you want the volume plan, then it's $300 for 10 visits.  Not bad?  Until they tell you that the 10 visits have to be completed within 30 days!  Again, if you have a chronic issue, this is fine.  Otherwise, this is a huge ripoff.  Finally, it's a cattle call  - about 3 mins per patient.  I don't have any expectations of spending a lot of time with me, but there is definitely a rushed feeling when you are with the \"doctor.\"  I just haven't had this experience in any chiropractor's office.  \n\nI'd recommend looking elsewhere.

I also love that the instructors will admit that some things are even challenging for them. They are professionals, but they have a relaxed attitude which really helps make you feel comfortable even if you are struggling. Additionally, I love that the class is as difficult as you make it. There are ways to adjust positions in order to make it easier or more challenging. For example, you can add weights for arm exercises or just not use any weights. A lot of the workout depends on how much you challenge yourself. Knowing how to control your muscles individually can help you get results sooner, but if don't know how to do this, you will learn after a few classes. Anyone can do these classes and the instructors help with positions and anything else you need. I really do enjoy Karve. My issue is simply finding time to squeeze into my busy schedule.

About halfway up in the elevator the back opens up to a window so you can see the Strip as you climb. \n\nUpon entering the club we immediately headed out to the roof, where there is a full bar, DJ and dance floor. There was also a little roped-off VIP area that would be nice for small parties. This section offered the best view (and a place to sit!) The view of the Strip is absolutely breathtaking! I was completely mesmerized and didn't leave my \"spot\" for the whole two hours or so we were there. The weather was perfect; not too hot and no wind. The music was great but I opted to dance where I was standing versus hitting the dance floor area because I couldn't bear the thought of losing my view!

Oh boy, if this is how the stinky old scraggly gold prospectors would eat back in the 1840's, then I think the Arizona Lottery dude is grossly underweight ( http://www.nba.com/media/suns/arizona_lottery_120.gif ).\n\nI was fair warned by Chris T. ( http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TQo2DFe6O6LWALv_awgcCQ ) that the portion sizes are very large there, and he wasn't kidding! You all know that feeling you get when you eat too much? I don't mean the feeling like \"...wow, I'm full...\" and you keep picking at the food. I don't even mean the feeling like \"...OMG, I can't believe I ate the whole thing!\". What I am referring to is that OTHER feeling, the one you DON'T want to admit you had. The one when you try to think back on it, you start to perspire and hope no one is watching you think about it. COME ON, YOU CAN'T DENY IT!!! It's the feeling you get when you eat soooooo much that .................I'm going to say it...............YOUR EYE'S HURT! There........I feel much better, I said it.\n\nNow, back to the restaurant. It's not their fault that I ate that much, no. It's my own fault because I scoffed at the original warning from Chris. I said \"I'm on a diet, and I can be strong\". \n\nThe wait time would have been real long except I called earlier and made a reservation (I suggest you do as well). I went to with my wife, sister and her boyfriend and whenever you go with more than 2 people you have to order appetizers. For some reason you know you aren't any MORE hungry than if you were alone or on a date, but I think your stomach thinks that there is \"strength in numbers\" so you can take on a bigger battle. Anyway, we ordered the cheesy potato soup, some avocado thingys and garlic bread. For my meal I ordered a pile of pasta and chicken. I DIDNT EVEN MAKE IT TO THE DESSERTS (....ouch......eye....pain)!\n\nThe potato soup was pretty good, but I've had better. It had a lot of onion/onion flavoring which is a big no no for my wife, and she was excited to order it. I didn't really enjoy the avocado thingys, they had a weird taste when combined with the side of dressing/sauce stuff. The garlic bread WAS the bomb though. Very greasy and garlicky and yummy! It went great with my meal which was a chicken alfredo over linguine (something along those lines). I'm pretty sure they serve their meals on a garbage can lid (or at least a plate of that size). It was piled high and wide. \n\nSo here's the million dollar question....\"Why would someone complain about large portion size? Take the rest home and save it for tomorrow\". Well that's because your portion size is reflected in the check. The prices were higher than a normal \"fast/sitdown\" type restaurant but the food wasn't much better. So you pay for MORE of the same that you can't even finish, and if you do finish it you run the risk of going blind!!!!\n\nNow I'm going to put my dark shades on, grab my long, retractable cane and go to Pizzeria Uno.....They are cheaper and I love the \"Rattlesnake Pasta\".......also I think they have a special seat for blind people.   :)", "stars": 3, "cool": 5, "useful": 5, "date": "2008-09-04"}, {"user_id": "Dsc9L1lTuEt5DCnNSU_UHw", "review_id": "FSNxEOILoXN_qUQNjksZfg", "funny": 0, "business_id": "V9qjoWogqqMWvFFpuASRYw", "text": "Great location and atmosphere.

I've had this done in the past but with a different colour so that the highlights still showed.  Not this time. I might as well have asked for a full dye job. My hair is now all one colour so the foils were pretty much a waste of time. The Deep Conditioning Treatment and Massage which was part of the Groupon package may as well not have happened either.  The massage was not done by someone who cared and, as days went by, I could see more damage than conditioning. The actual, very light blond colour itself, however, is nice, not brassy.\n\nI was really hoping for a more up-to-date hair style but the owner, who did the cut, seemed to be not that way inclined. I got the classic bob. Granted, the back is cut slightly shorter than the front and there is a little graduated texturing all around but getting her to do even these small, dated innovations was like pulling hens' teeth. She really didn't want to do it but I and an old colleague who dropped in for a visit talked her into it. To be fair, it was early on a Friday night, she was running late for a social event and was distracted by the ever advancing  hands of the clock, so not being fully engaged in my hair cut was understandable, not.\n\nSo, it cost me $113.27 + $59 for the Groupon.  I was told it would normally have cost me over $300. Say what?\n\nOh, and the entertainment part that I mentioned at the top? It came from the old colleague who dropped in for a visit.

We drove down to the office to turn in our application in person, on a wednesday afternoon at 4. The place was a ghost town. We tried calling the office, and knocked on the office door and no one was there. They do not have business hours posted on their building or website, and were under the assumption, from our experience with other realty companies, that they would be open until 5 pm. We called our realtor and he was puzzled as to why they would not be there. He got a hold of the lady that runs Shannon Day and she told him that their hours are 9am to 3pm Monday -Friday!!   I do not understand how one expects to have a successful business when your hours are 9am to 3pm.\nCome to find out that she is the only one who runs the place and is almost impossible to get a hold of. Our application was accepted, although it took almost a week to get an answer back, we also have no idea the name of the owner or where he is located.\nWe loved the property, and decided to give it a shot and move in. We gave them our deposit (which included a $250 cleaning deposit, and they stated that they were going to bring in a cleaning service to do some basic carpet cleaning and wipe down of walls, toilets, etc.)\nCome moving day once we got really close to the walls and got up close and personal with the house we discovered that the walls were filthy, even the ceilings seemed to have some sort of browish yellow splatter on them, even in the bathrooms! The kitchen was the worst. The vent above the stove had old caked on yellow grease which took forever to get off and the tops of the vaulted ceilings in the kitchen (which are almost impossible to reach, just by the way they were designed) had red spaghetti like sauce splatter on them. The walls were dirty and looked like they hadnt been cleaned in a long time, the showers had black mold in them and they had obviously not been cleaned. The only thing that had appeared to be cleaned were the toilets.\nThe first night that were supposed to be moving our stuff in was spent in hours of scrubbing walls and cabinets, baseboards, and painting mismatched half assed paint jobs that were very visible and looked horrible. I dont even know why someone would bother in painting a patch on a wall that does not match at all.\nWhen we ran our vacuum cleaner throughout the house for the first time and our entire canister in the vacuum was filled with fur and dirt, like it hadnt been vaccumed in a long time, and my husband also cleaned the carpets and the water that was being sucked up in the machine was pitch black. It was very obvious that the place had not been cleaned. Most of our money so far has been put into cleaning and painting pure neglect and stupidity. We take pride in our home and dont settle for our home looking dirty with mismatching paint. We contacted Shannon Day so they could send a repairman out to fix the oven (the oven would not ignite and cook food) and that took 2 weeks, the only time that they responded right away was for a plumbing issue. We have only been in the home for a few months and over the last month a few drawers in the kitchen broke because the design of the home builders was to STAPLE the drawer tracks in. My husband had to fix that by hand and secure it to ensure it wouldnt break on us again, but whos to say that others wont break and thats something that Shannon Day isnt going to have someone come and fix. Overall the home is older, but if it was cared for properly by previous tenants then we would not be having these issues, which is frustrating that things are slowly failing on us. Overall, so far, i'm not very happy with Shannon Day.\nOne Good thing out of this is that we have really nice neighbors next to and across from us.\n\nI'm nervous to see how we will be treated come the day that we move out.\nOnly time will tell, but I wont be surprised if it all goes sour.\n\nWhen it comes to doing business with this company....you have been warned.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 7, "date": "2013-10-28"}, {"user_id": "ruVwLL_rWv_s4d0ANPttPw", "review_id": "cME4zbR5g2OlfcThOUAmzA", "funny": 0, "business_id": "0lfRx2ChaBsUHeYY2-799w", "text": "I purchased a trial of 5 classes for $30 (including a free pair of gloves) off of their company website.

The workout was really great though, the instructors were very helpful and would walk us through the punches and kicks. They were very motivating, and if we were not capable of doing a certain move, then they would show us an alternative and lighter version of that certain move, so we wouldnt hurt ourselves, which I thought was great. \n\nHere is the part that threw me off. I'm still sweating profusely and still processing all that went on, and after the class one of the instructors sat us down and showed us the membership plans. $149 per month for 7 months, $125 per month for 12 months, or a punch card option of 35 classes for $149 and 65 classes for $125. Then on top of that was a $197 start up fee!!! Ridiculous and very pricey, and the fact that they were asking me if I wanted to sign up after finishing my very first class was irritating. \n\nI'm going to finish the other 4 classes, but I am not signing up, it's expensive, and I can find another place that's a lot cheaper than what they are asking for.", "stars": 3, "cool": 1, "useful": 19, "date": "2015-02-04"}, {"user_id": "ruVwLL_rWv_s4d0ANPttPw", "review_id": "IuwOxnVaT8p7mMn8RUAP-g", "funny": 1, "business_id": "FQiEfRlCsoiarD1h6N7rig", "text": "I called this place to try and get an estimate on the cost and what programs they would have available for my children. \n\nThe lady on the phone didnt sound excited or happy to be there.

My experiences have varied greatly depending on the instructor.  I found both Michael and Crystal to be great instructors.  The studio itself, however, is below average.  I've continued to come back mostly because the location is close to my home.  This morning, I left there feeling very frustrated, and I will not return. \n\nMy sister is visiting from out of town and asked that we find a yoga class to go to together.  Saturday mornings have consistently been advertised as the $5 community class at Yoga Hive.  I checked the schedule online to be sure that the class was not canceled due to the holiday season.  I observed that it was not canceled but that there was a sub (Kimberly, the owner).  \n\nWhen we showed up this morning, as is often the case, the entry way was terribly crowded, and we had to wait outside in the elements as people inside took their time making space for others.  From the entrance, I could hear the owner chatting loudly.  This is not the kind of intentional calm and mindfulness that I would expect from a yoga studio.  When my sister approached Kimberly and let her know that it was her first time there, unlike her chatty rapport with the people she seemed to know, she did not welcome her, but asked her to stand to the side.  We then realized that the class was $14 (the regular admission) because there was a substitute instructor.  For a studio that is located in the quickly gentrifying Garfield neighbor, I feel that the very least that could be done to cater to the \"community\" is to offer a weekly $5 class.  If there is a change in that price, it should be stated loudly and clearly on the website.   For my sister and I, especially during the holiday season, a $14 yoga class is out of our budget, and we are certainly more economically privileged than most of Yoga Hive's neighbors.", "stars": 2, "cool": 1, "useful": 8, "date": "2013-12-21"}, {"user_id": "wqLERX8HKwlPhxp-B4X5-w", "review_id": "BpErH3HyZg3dxBDm-dvWQQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "zuUWG7OdMv6awFRYhEYT5Q", "text": "I would've given this restaurant 0 stars, but was unable to do so, thus 1 star is being generous.

After about 20 mins, I asked our waitress if the kitchen had possibly forgotten my order and she said it takes longer to make and that it would be ready soon. Ok, understandable. But after another 25-30 mins, it still had not come out yet. When I asked another waitress who took our order, she said that she would check on it. It didn't come out until we were pretty much full and about ready to order dessert. So I know they definitely forgot to ring it in. Also, it took forever to get refills on our waters. And after our waitress came to take our sushi orders again, she only took mine then left immediately after - without even looking at my other friends and asking if they wanted anything else.

Genius with a capital G.

Thats what this restaurant is KNOWN for!! She huffed and asked if they would drop some and told us it would be a wait...Wtf...it was that easy?????\nThats fine Chicky just help out , try to care for your pay. Then got the order wrong at the end and forgot our tea.\nSo we tried again today, and lucky us her lovey face was waiting for us to order....I ordered my son chicken tenders and they were out till tomorrow !WHAT???!! I asked if some could be dropped , got a huff and told they are too frozen .... I asked about the empty chicken racks , she said there was a wait for everything. Mind you, the card machines were down and it was cash only , they weren't busy at all.\n I asked when they close, it was in 5 hours! Soooo maybe getting a prep work done would have been smart.\nI  asked for the manager,  couldnt handle the blank stare of the cashier who only showed she wished to be anywhere but here. The manager came up , I told her about last time and this time , she was so sweet and helpful , I got everything I came in to order , just had to wait an extra 20 mins for cooking. A nice attitude asking me to wait doesn't bother me. \nI did get to watch how many people came in while waiting and were mad, not because of the card machines being down, but the lack of available food and poor attitude of the cashier.

His program is a call in format so you never know what questions folks are going to ask but Steve Gregg goes into great detail to ensure the caller understands the answer they seek for their own personal growth so of course that helps us all, Saved and not Saved YET! If you like talk show format you'll love this program! This program is listener sponsored yet no one gets paid on this staff per Mr. Gregg they are all volunteers.  He also offers tons of free downloads, I believe there's over 900 topics at his website AWESOME HUH?\n\nDAYS OF DESTINY\" on Thursdays from 6-7 pm with Pastor Scott Emmert and Evangelist Diana is one of my favs because THEY TEACH AND PREACH THE TRUTH in an easy to LEARN AND REMEMBER unique sort of way.  Pastor Emmert is diligent and fun, Evangelist Diana talks, I don't see notes and well let me say it like this, I believe she either replies to a question the Pastor asks her or she says what The Holy Spirit has layed on her heart for the listeners.  She is ready set and go tell it like it is, she's pretty funny too.  They add some FUN into the mix, you never know what or maybe I should say when; they are going to say something funny, but they will so I try to NEVER MISS THEM because I get THE TRUTH AND LAUGHTER, It's obvious they take their duty serious and they have the fruits of the HOLY SPIRIT, both MEN AND WOMEN OF GOD; as well so  GREAT TEAM FOR JESUS.  I've never heard Pastor Emmert ask for donations, so refreshing as that is, it does take money to be on radio.  I'd sponser if they'd ask or as I'm writing I guess I'd say send it to kkvv and as Fred says; make sure you put Days of Destiny on your check and on the envelope so it goes to their airtime.  They are down to earth, don't believe THE GOSPEL IS FOR SELL so help keep this great team on air because they are afraid to TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH IN GOD'S WRITTEN WORD, HALLELUJUH FOR THAT. HELP IF YOU CAN.\n\nBrends Ward's \"FORGIVEN\" is on air onThursdays from 5-5:30 is so wonderful with this program aiming towards the youth and she has a program about Grandmothers, not sure when that day is but GRANDMA'S RULE AMEN!  RADIO BOOK CLUB is another program that is great with Brenda that features writer's, poets, songwriters, etc. get their testimonies and product out to other's that will benefit.  She does a one on one interview asking ten questions with her guest.  She is a Publisher so check her out too. She's a very nice lady and WOMAN OF GOD!  \n\nAll programs need sponsored with help paying for airtime so we can benefit from their programs on wkkvv. We better keep the GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST ON AS LONG AS WE CAN, AS THEY ARE TRYING TO MUZZLE THE PREACHERS AND TEACHERS, EVANGELISTS, TAKING CROSSES DOWN IN THE USA, REALLY? LET'S SUPPORT THESE WHO ARE \"TRULY CALLED\" SO THE UNBLIEVERS CAN GET SOME TRUTH IN THEM AND SOME SOULS CAN BE SAVED. TUNE IN,YOU'LL LOVE IT AT KKVV. AND NO, I DON'T WORK FOR THEM.

No warranty on parts but service was free. 400 for new motherboard cuz cant just replace chip. At the time, it was not made clear to me this was a used mb and there was only 30 days warranty. I thought my mb had the defective chip installation taken care of. Two weeks ago, the mbp went out again. Once again \"there must be something in the air because several other people have had the same problem recently\" is what they say, no warranty and 400 bucks again. I looked up this issue and found apple admitted there was a problem with this model several years ago. I asked orchard if they knew about this problem and still chose to sell this model. They said some never had this problem so it was ok for them to sell. So after 1200 bucks I have a dead laptop that I was never warned about. If I replace the mb it could go out again. Since then, I bought a 13\" 2011 from craigslist for 600 cash. I would not buy from here again because no warranty on parts and I feel that they would not have a problem selling me another potentially defective product without warning me.

I do not normally use a business that has no reviews but I did not have a lot of choices. I like the fact that they are \"family owned\" or so they say.

They called me back and said that I needed to replace the spring with two springs and change all of the rollers. I have experienced this before and did not feel too bad about that. However the price they quoted me was way higher than I have paid elsewhere in the past and higher than other quotes I recently got. So I said no. Because of this they really let me know that they could not warranty the work several times. They sounded irritated that I would not do what they said. This is when I lost trust. Later they told me they were done and we settled up. After this I called my tenant who actually lives there. I came to find out that she (an auto-mechanic for over 25 years) had to remove the master link from the chain to be able to open the door. However, the master link was nowhere to be found and they did not have one on their truck. My tenant was baffled by this because as a technician you always have every part that you may need with you. What this means is they left without testing their work. The owner said he has never had to replace the master link \"in all his years of doing this\"....my tenant said he was at best in his late 20's. She then called other places and they all had master links on their trucks. My tenant said she felt like they did not want to do anything else after I did not want to do the other work and their attitude really changed for the worse. She asked if she could you the master link from her bike but they said no and were very condescending....(she is and auto mechanic 25 years). After she put the master link on from her bike chain even with her arthritis and it works fine.

Thankfully the line moved along fairly quickly and we were able to pay (you pay up front here) and be seated within 15 minutes. I did notice that there was a wait between groups being seated and that there were always open tables with seating available so perhaps during peak times they should staff one or two more hostesses to get it going more quickly. \n\nAfter getting our drink orders taken, we all scurried to the buffet and explored the fairly well varied selection. I did notice that some of the plates were slightly worn out and that the whole restaurant, including the buffet floor, had worn carpet but the plates were clean and the buffet lines seemed organized so it didn't concern me too much. The sushi was plentiful, but nothing special, with the run of the mill rolls you'd expect everywhere. However, the hot food choices were excellent. The different dishes had distinct flavor as opposed to all being slightly more sweet here, slightly more spicy here heaps of goopy chicken. The beef broccoli was great, no skimping on the beef, the baby octopus was tender and spicy, the stir fried rice noodle was great, and the ribs were tender and delicious. The desert selection was fairly standard with a soft serve machine, fruit, and little cakes and cookies. \n\nIf you're looking for a large buffet to load up on tasty Asian food, this is definitely a good place to go. Sushi might let you down a bit if you're an aficionado, but I feel the rest of the buffet definitely makes up for it.

During certain hours, the prices of drinks and food would vary, from lowest prices about 4 pm, and higher prices into the evening. We got there about 6 pm, when the price for a selected menu was $6 each item, and the price of a drink was $7. These were supposed to be happy hour, or discounted, prices. The regular price for a draft of domestic beer was $7. I assumed the happy hour price would be less than $7, so I ordered 2 Buds. The price turned out to be $7 each. No discount at all. On the food menu, the regular price for the steak street tacos was $18, The price for the happy hour was $6. That looked like a good deal, so I ordered it. Several minutes later, the server brought out a corn tortilla, about the size of a small bagel. On it was a tiny amount of cheese, and a little spoonful of meat. I asked the waitress if this was the regular price, and she said the regular price of $18 was for three of these minuscule servings.  I pointed out that each would then be $6, which was the happy hour price. In other words, for the happy hour you get one taco for $6, but the regular price was 3 for $18, which is $6. So, the beer and the taco were exactly the same price for the happy hour and the regular menu. Very Deceptive. My advice - before ordering at this restaurant, be very careful. They really offer no happy hour deals. By the way, the taco was OK, but not worth $6. I would say a fair price for the tiny bite is 50 cents.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2016-12-23"}, {"user_id": "CDKOdJmufnL3Ailxz6RPSg", "review_id": "jvoxAYXr5UAVnsS-fEirxQ", "funny": 0, "business_id": "JsCKeWHA8n_5mFQ3F6t4UA", "text": "The food was good for the price.

I do appreciate that they now added a bench by the window which looks a lot more comfortable than those stumps.\n\nSince my first visit to Hawker Bar I've visited it at least 4-5 more times; so my review will primarily be about my food experiences in each of my visits.\n\nIn my first visit I was greeted and seated with cardboard menus; the menu itself isn't very big on selections but it offers a wide enough variety for an establishment of this scale. Upon looking at the menu I was immediately drawn to the Hainanese Chicken Rice dish. I've had this dish before in other \"Asian\" restaurants and it's usually a pretty safe and tasty dish. Needless to say the poached chicken was succelent and juicy, and the accompanying sauces (sticky sweet soy and homemade chili sauce) paired very well with the dish. I finished my meal with dessert, the ice Kacang. It was interesting eating flavoured bits of ice from various syrups, which would be new experience to some. I, on the otherhand, was neither impressed nor unimpressed by it.\n\nOn my next visit, I was a little bit more adventurous and tried their seafood special which was a whole deep fried Sea Bream drizzled with sticky soy sauce and paired with a Banana Blossom slaw. The fish was very meaty and juicy also and the slaw provided a much needed crisp that contrast with the crunchy fish.\n\nOn my third visit I decided to try the Hawker Laksa Lemak, a coconut curry soup with rice noodles, snow peas, eggplant, red pepper and puffy tofu; and I added chicken to mine. This dish however wasn't as exciting for me. I found the coconut soup a little too tart that it was hard to really distinguish the flavours of the other ingredients.\n\nOn my fourth visit I ordered the Rendang Curry which had coconut rice and braised ox cheeks. Before ordering I remembered my experience with the Laksa Lemak and inquired whether it used the same curry base. The server happily helped me adjust the curry to a flavour I could enjoy more which I greatly appreciated. However, I found that in general I wasn't a fan of the coconut rice, and it was too dessert-like for my tastes. It was a great dish all around, but it wasn't suitable to my palette.\n\nOn my fifth visit, I decided to try another of their seafood dishes, the \"Singapore style\" noodles. This is a twist another very safe and common asian dish, but I found it was a very alluring innovation. The shrimps are juicy and plump, the noodles were tossed in a very flavourful range of spices, it was certainly a delight to eat.\n\nFinally in my most recent visit I had went back to try the Hainanese Chicken again. This time I ordered a side of Yellow Soy broccoli to broaden my diet. The broccoli itself was a bit disappointing. The soy mixture is flavourful and reminded me of miso, however the way they prepared the broccoli seemed lacking. It was explained to me that they boil the broccoli then sautee it with the sauce I assume. However, it seemed the boiling process may have made the broccoli lose it's crispiness/crunchiness. I think the dish would have been more successful with a little less boiling to remain a firmer texture for the broccoli.\n\nAll in all, I love the new addition of Hawkerbar to the Ossington strip.

Finally I went outside and asked a couple guys that were out there where the parts department was.  They politely directed me.  When I got to the counter no one was there.  I peeked through the window to the back.   Saw no one.  About a minute later a guy bustled out, looked at me and said someone would be out in a minute.  Then he left.

I was surprised to find that I could get beer from my old hometown of Burlington as well as Oakville next door - all the way to beers from around Ontario, Quebec (some excellent ones) and from around the world. I like that they normally use the traditional glasses used for the particular beers (hefeweissen glasses for hefeweissen beer, glasses from the particular brewers of the beer etc.). The variety of on-tap and bottled beers is excellent, and I usually try one new beer each time we go. \n\nThe service has always been excellent with very friendly (and knowledgeable) servers who seem genuinely happy to be there, and Erin (the very cheerful owner) ensuring that the service and drinks/food are all ok and that everyone is happy.  \n\nWe are vegetarians, and appreciate that there are a few selections for us (many pubs have just one, token veggie meal - but Stout has a few options which is great so that we don't get bored). The food we've had has been excellent, and the portions are substantial (sometimes we find it's better to just split a dish between the two of us instead of one each - unless we're particularly famished). \n\nOn one occasion, some friends were with us and one of the meals wasn't cooked fully (the only time in the 15 or 20 times we've been there) - but once the staff were alerted to it, they immediately apologized, took it back and created a new meal (I suspect that most places would have tried microwaving it, but in this case they created the meal from scratch again to ensure it was correctly done and handled it very professionally). \n\nThere are various areas of the pub and each are very inviting and comfortable (front room with fireplace/comfy seats/windows on to the street, the bar area, the back seating area and the patio).

He went to the service manager, James Macias, who finally found my car...but offered no apologies and did not address the fact that I said Earnhardt lost my business.  He was young and more irritated that I was upset instead of trying to keep my business.  I guess Earnhardt is hiring bar room bouncers for service managers these days....good luck with that.    \n\nEarnhardt sends me mailings and emails all the time asking for my business....and when they get it they don't seem to know how to keep it.

I saved $60 to lose out on a $75 credit.The check-in lady seemed to care less and didn't seem to want to be working that day.  On top of this, there were no suite upgrades as the hotel was full (no big deal here). Minus one star for a bad start to the weekend.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the hotel itself. The rooms were very nice and very modern. The casino was nice and the bars were fairly cool as well. The pools were nice. There are three to choose from and then there is a pay-pool called Liquid which i did not try. The spa was inexpensive at $30/day. What was nice about the spa was the outdoor pool overlooking Liquid. \n\nAfter drinking all night and waking up with a hangover, i thought I forgot how to work with electronics because nothing in my room worked. No lights, couldn't open the curtain, the TV wouldn't turn on, etc. After waiting for engineering to show up for 45 minutes, I finally got my room 'powered up' again. Evidently, I wasn't alone as a sudden power surge caused a large number of rooms to go dark.

They also delivered on a $100 dining card... one of the ones from restaurant.com that they sell for $40 or less and you have to spend $200 to use! What a joke!\n\nInstead of getting to exactly how the package worked, the salesman kept talking about \"pussy\" (suggesting that having this package would help me get it) and took an hour to even start discussing the package at all. Despite talking to several people there trying to get details of the plan (such as seeing exact numbers for how points translate at certain resorts), they kept trying to sell me on ideas without details. Total scam operation from the details on the phone, the gift you get for attending, and the way they try to sell based on emotion rather than facts.

So, 5 stars for the price of the wine.\n\nWe did the charcuterie board, and it was a deal for $16 (Happy Hour pricing).  We've been charged more for less at other places.

She arrived on time and did an amazing job on both my hair and make up. They both lasted all night long after the wedding was over (I got married at 1pm)The make up she used was also amazing.

I am changing my previous 2 stars to 5. It was really that much better!   Way to go! I am a fan again! \n\n\nBelow is my previous post \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is the 2nd time I have been to this location where the service was not good.    I know they can do better and the training is better than this, since I used to work for Oregano's.   \n\nThe first time was a month or so ago, but I chalked that up to the place just having a bad night.  I know they happen.  I went back again a few days ago with some friends but  the service was just the same; slow,  kinda rude, and un-attentive. \n\nThe experience started when we showed up with a 25 min wait on a Friday night (which i know is common), no big deal. We got some drinks at the bar, and sat in the waiting area.  Then I decided I would grab an appetizer for our group. I walked up to the hostess/togo counter to order and pay for it and the to-go girl started to ring me up with no problems. Awesome...right??  NO, the manager  (I know she was the manager, because she was wearing black) stopped her mid transaction and asked me to step to the other side of the counter to order with an actual server.  My thoughts.... OK fine, whatever. The problem was the tone and that she said \"no she can't help you, she has to help you over there\" and pointed to an actual server on the other side of the counter.  So I walked and had to wait until she was done putting in another order, after a  few min she was able to help me.  I get it, they are busy, but what was wrong with the to-go counter taking an order?  Especially since there was no wait and she was not on the phone.  That was off-putting.  I say this because I know better, I know Oregano's trains better than this. \n\nMoving on to dinner.  Since we already had drinks from the bar, I guess your server decided we didn't need any  refills the rest of the night, even after waiting 45 min to get our food.   We didn't order anything that takes a while (2 pasta dishes and a sausage sandwich), the kitchen was not slammed, since it was 9pm with several empty tables. Basically I had no drink for my dinner. We saw our server a total of 3 times.  Once to take our order, 50 min later to see how the food was, and last to drop the check. \n\nAs we were leaving the manager was giving a half-assed apology to another table for the abnormal amount of time things took, and honestly we were there MUCH longer than them. \n\nThe disappointing part is that I love Oregano's and I talk it up all the time.

You don't contact the client and tell them when they can come in, you ASK if the new time works for them. Where's the courtesy?)  Anyway, I called back within about a minute and left a message to keep it at 7pm.  I then went to some lengths to rearrange my schedule to make it a half hour ahead of time as requested so I don't get charged $25. (Who does that for people that are late? No-show, sure.

Just a certain tone I picked up on. (Clearly this wasn't the voice of experience talking. More like the voice of adolescence.) And yeah, sure, shlt happens. The heater broke down. Fine. Whatever. But to be scooted around like a schedule item rather than asking my permission as a person beforehand (1), and then to be cancelled an hour before my appointment without any other solution better than \"we'll have to reschedule you\" (2), was just void of creativity to say the least. In my business, if I needed to cancel someone unexpectedly, I would have added an extra half-hour to the next session, or at least offered some sort of a credit - something other than, \"we'll just have to reschedule you.\" Where's the incentive to come back? Do you want return clients or not? All I can say is business must be REALLY good. But wait a minute - you're running giveaways through a deal coupon vendor! Way to go...\n\nSo True REST Float Spa, please get this: THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION IS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. Give a (potential) customer the feeling that they're not really that important, even once, and you've lost them. You just lost me. Care much about that?. By the sound of the 20-something BS West clone's voice on the other end of the phone, I kinda doubt it.", "stars": 1, "cool": 1, "useful": 11, "date": "2016-01-17"}, {"user_id": "c0M6NhoyoTtkkwwBKoY38w", "review_id": "Fn0UmYpXucys4qW8G9raJw", "funny": 3, "business_id": "S52kLuHEa8RCSoXQvZql0g", "text": "First impression as you walk into the place - HO-LEE SH*T! \n\nNot just a typical Phoenix \"rainbow\" desperate-for-money, income-only, slippery-sleezy hole-in-the-wall kind of place. This place is what I would call \"upstanding\". I can't believe the transformation of what used to be \"the above described\" kind of place, to the elegant and sophisticated, bring-your-out-of-towners-in kind of place that it is now. I love it! The owner, Matt, appears to have a vision and I like it a lot! Seriously, got friends coming in? This is a place you can be proud to bring them to. Honestly, I would say this is more of an L.A. or Palm Springs bar planted in the middle of the desert. \n\nHaving said all that, here's what you get: actual stemmed wine and martini glasses with all the appropriate elixirs to go in them. Where most rainbow bars offer wine by the color (red, pink or white), Diablos practically gives you wine choices by the year. I drink martinis and I know what I like and how I like them. Most places don't get it when I order a Belvedere martini straight up with three blue cheese stuffed olives. Here it comes: freezer-cold stemmed glass with a napkin under the glass - A NAPKIN UNDER THE GLASS! (From Chicago here. A napkin *always* goes under the glass, but not in Phoenix. Why not?! Pet pieve of mine.)  The olives: not just blue cheese smashed into the olive by monkey hands, but the best BC olives I've ever had, purchased from Queen Creek Olive Mill (about an hour outside of Phoenix). The kind that melt in your mouth. Yea!\n\nOk so its not about the olives, the cold stemmed glass, the broad selection of wine,  booze and beer - its really about attention to detail. Detail! That's what I really appreciate. Like this is the way a customer is supposed to be treated and that's what comes across. Sure the prices are a little higher - you're paying to be treated well. What would you expect?\n\nDid I mention that the servers - yes there are servers! - actually walking around to take your order? You won't see this at Charlies or Stacy's or any other rainbow establishment in this town. Love that too.\n\nFrom the for-sale art on the wall, to the orange-scented restrooms, to the verde green paint on the patio walls to match the outlying landscape, this place just rocks. Honestly, I'm so glad and so grateful that finally somebody has stepped up to the plate to offer a different perspective on the already weather-beaten and shadowy gay community that somehow manages to live in the furnace that is Phoenix. This is truly a step in the right direction. I only hope that other like establishments pop up to compete with Diablos, if for no other reason than to be better than Diablos. That way we all win. At the moment however, there is nothing else that even comes close to Los Diablos. The place stands like an oasis. Thank you Matt, for doing this.

But I can honestly say we are all in agreement in that this was the WORST food we had ever had!!! I cannot remember having a meal as bad at this from the food to service. \n\nWe came to find ourselves at this restaurant during a trip to Montreal. After a long day of biking and sightseeing we were looking forward to a nice ethnic dinner and after seeing the reviews we assumed this would be the place. We were sorely mistaken. First the service was horrible we waited ten minutes for water. Water that was room temperature, no ice at all. Then we had to wait another ten minutes for our order to be taken an order that was completely wrong. The owner did say his waitress was on vacation but quite honestly it was his waitress, cook and his manners and hospitality. The first thing we ordered Baba Ghanouj came out as the salad mix an error he made from not writing it down. This salad mix was horrible the vegetables were so vinegary they were inedible and spit out immediately. The baba ghanouj and tahini that came with it were equally as bad. The pita that came with it was straight from a bag not even heated. And it tasted like paper. At this point we should have left.\n\nThen the entrees appeared and not at once. First the koshary. The chickpeas were undercooked and hard  and overall flavors were not there at all I barely ate 5 bites. Our other entrees include Molokhya which was dry and tasted like it was cooked in a microwave. And two orders of fetat Shawarma which there is nothing to say about but that it was awful. \n\nWhen he came back to clear our plates and saw our food was hardly touched. We told him we did not like it. Yet unlike at any other restraurant with courteous service he did not offer to comp us or ask if we want something else but instead made us pay the way overpriced total for the horrible food. Now I'm not the type to ask for free things but I honestly feel cheated. This was the worse food of my life.\n\nSAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ANYWHERE ELSE.

I first saw my dress online, the designer is Justin Alexander, I called and let them know I just wanted to try it on. I told the receptionist my budget to insure that it was within it so that I wouldn't get disappointed trying on a dress I couldn't afford. She said it was in my budget and we set the date for a try on. I brought one of my bridesmaids with me, my mom lives out of town and wasn't coming for a visit until the end of the month and I was not going to purchase anything without her blessing. When we walked in we were greeted with smiles and I was introduced to my consultant. Rochelle was amazing, she was a great listener and never once pressured me into a purchase. At the end we left without the dress but made a second appointment for when my mom could attend. When we came back I requested Rochelle to help me and she made the experience a once in a lifetime for me and mom. My mom and grandma both cried seeing me in my dress. Now I'm a 34DD but a size 2 everywhere else so my dress was ordered in a size 16 to fit my boobs. I was very concerned over the size but was reassured by Rochelle that they would altar it perfectly to my body. That's when I meet Irene,  she added straps to match the belt of the dress and custom formed it to my body and in the end it was a perfect fit. Instead of string to bustle the dress she used snaps and my maid of honor loved her for that. Irene suggested snaps because of how heavy the dress was. On the day of pick up both Irene and Rochelle were there to make sure that everything went as planned. I tried on the dress one more time with my mom and maid of honor so that they could be shown how to bustle the dress. I am so thankful to everyone at this lovely shop for not only giving me the experience I see on TV such as say yes to the dress but for providing me the dress of my dreams!

That said, the Cobb was very good. Best I've ever had? No, but still worth it to me. The Sweet Tots were a strange idea to me, but incredibly good. I do wish they served some sort of aioli sauce or something with them but that's not a huge deal. The White Russian was large and very good.\n    Overall, it was slightly spendy but there was a LOT of food, too much, really. My wife and I could have probably split the meal n still have been satisfied. Plus, since we were so full, we had to miss out on the Cap'n Crunch Shake, n that makes me sad.\n    I would go back again, build my own burger with my wife and leave room for the shake.", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "date": "2012-02-16"}, {"user_id": "FGDGQNzD8cAQJIw0creIGg", "review_id": "ayJI7gvLjMQaJpVQlLPvFw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "Cni2l-VKG_pdospJ6xliXQ", "text": "Trendy burger restaurant by famed chef Hubert Keller.

The sales gentleman, Michael I think was his name, said they had a process that could remove those spots. Yeah right I thought! Very skeptically I asked for him to prove it with a test sample. He took about ten minutes if his time and did 4 test samples for me. It looked amazing, the hard water spots disappeared. I received a quote for a very reasonable amount and setup an appointment for the follow day. Very pleased with the service and would highly recommend for tough water spot removal! 5 stars for the detail work. \n\nThe car wash was ok at best.

I looked around for car audio shops to fix the alarm system on my car and found this one on yelp with 5 stars with about 15 reviews. I was skeptical since I thought maybe they were fake accounts made to boost their ratings to draw more customers. Very pessimistic thinking, I know, but whatever I decided to give this place a shot.\n\nThe problem with my car alarm was that it would go off at random times and I needed this to stop for obvious reasons. Called at 8am when they opened and they scheduled me for a 10am appointment. The guy that answered didn't ask for my name, but remembered I called about a car alarm when I arrived. I wasn't helped right away since a lot of the staff was busy running around, but made it a point to tell me they will be with me as soon as possible. Plus I think it was the owner that came up to me personally and asked the staff if I had been helped, which he did with all other customers that came in. After waiting about 5-10 minutes I was helped and they brought my car into their garage. They worked on it and after a short period they came to tell me that my alarm was dysfunctional but could disengage it so it wouldn't go off at random intervals. They cut the wires to disengage the system and told me that I still will be able to use my remote key lock/unlock to get into my car, but it won't make a horn noise or flash the lights to notify the car is locked. I was fine with this since it was a temporary fix to my problem, but I still need to get a new alarm system. The owner of the shop ran through the many options they offer and mentioned there was a lifetime warranty on all of the alarms they installed except 1. I thanked him for being honest and upfront with me and told him I would need to think about what alarm I would want since I didn't want to drop $200-$300 that day.\n\nAfter I got my car back I asked him how much I owed. He said the service was complementary and I was shocked. I got my problem fixed for free. I am so amazed at how nice, courteous, and genuine these guys are for fixing my problem for free.

Well, I didn't want to drive to First Wok.  Then Number One Wok opened (yes, this review is from when this business opened).  I picked up their menu.  It was almost exactly the same as First Wok.  Were they related?  Sure looked like it.  Are they still?  No idea.  Anyway, I found the menu amusing.

So I gave it a try.  \n\nAnd I really liked it.  No, I didn't order any of the standard things like sweet sour whatever or broccoli cow.  I randomly picked things based on the protein or noodle base or whatever caught my attention.  I did this four or five times before I got some favorites going.

So we had main course and appetizer together. A mistake was made with one of my friends's order, so he had to wait at least ten minutes for his dish to be prepared all over again.

I needed new work shoes and like I said, I wasn't making a fashion statement and I didn't have any leeway in design or style anyway. The associate brought out two shoes, neither of which were the one I asked for. I asked if I could get the original shoe. The salesman played dumb and acted as if he was confused that they weren't the right shoes, (while holding the original which looked completely different in his hand). \nStill, no big deal, so I ask again for that one shoe in a 7.5, explaining (again) that it is the only one that meets my work requirements. He brings out the correct shoe, says this is the 7.5 and walks away. I try it on and it's huge, I'm confused but I ask a nearby woman if I can see the size smaller, then I check the box, and he brought me an 8. Turns out they didn't have my size, so he first tries to sell me on other shoes that I don't want, then tries to send me home with the wrong size knowing that I'll be unhappy and need new shoes in another week.

Yes, a sandwich can be that influential. When I visit a Primanti Brothers restaurant, I tend to order the Cajun chicken sandwich because it's simply that good. Well prepared chicken, home made coleslaw, crisp French fries. It doesn't take complex algorithms to understand that this combination is heavenly.\n\nThe service at the Monroeville location is very good. I know a lot of the servers and everybody who's waited on my friends and I have always had a cheerful demeanor. The food is served promptly as well. One quick tip for this particular location: don't rest your beers near the edges of the warped tables, unless you have quick reflexes.\n\nOne of the reasons I frequent Primantis as often as I do is the Penguins and Steelers game specials. Get your wonderfully mediocre IC Lights for as cheaply as they're made. In all honesty though, the specials here are extremely competitive. You can easily get a quality dinner and a few beers during a hockey or football game for around $10 - which is impressive for this city.

While the Tijuana satisfied me, I'll be looking to try another sandwich next time.  It's still one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten, but it was just a little too well blended for me:  the first bite tasted exactly the same as the last.  Very good as comfort food, but not very...exciting.  \n\nThe poutine, though!  Everything the reviews said and more!  I'll admit, I had doubts and deliberated a long time before choosing to order it.  Who wants limp fries instead of crispy ones? Well, the potato skins more than make up for the lack of crispiness. And, the cheese and gravy on top adds much more flavor than mere salt.  Plus, the texture is amazing!  You don't really feel like you're eating fries, really.  I really don't know what else to say to describe how wonderful this dish is.

So their were 5 in our party and we decided with the Large and small beef combo 2x brisket, short rib, ribeye, and skirt stk. The lady who served us our food had a name tag that said Trainee, so I was like this isn't going to be good. The Trainee took our order but didn't seem knowledgeable. She took our drink orders and we also ordered 5 Rice's for us and also 2 steamed egg 2 Tofu Bean soup. So they started bringing us our side dishes which looked promising. We began eating our side dishes and became thirsty. They didn't bring us any water and had to ask for water and she forgot that we ordered soda along with the water. Then we had to ask her for our rice that we ordered coz we were eating our sides without any rice. Then our faces were a mess because we didn't have any napkins and had to ask for napkins as well. So things are becoming a little irritating by now because we had to ask for all utensils and water, and our side dishes. \n\nSo Trainee started cooking our food, again we ran out of our sides and had to ask for more. Trainee never said a word to us as she was cooking and she didn't properly divide the meats to our party. She cut the meats by half and their were 5 of us so the 3 of us got less meat and we had to ask her to split it up evenly. As she was cooking the smoke was getting in our faces because she didn't bring the vent down and I couldn't breathe which was unpleasant. As we were eating our brisket we asked for our 2nd steamed egg and bean soup and she said that it was coming out. I didn't understand why they just didn't bring all 4 of the soups out because the 5 of us had to try and split the two of the soups and it was just a hassle. My wife and I had to wait for the second set of soups before I could try it. \n\nWhen it was time for our ribeye another cook came. I guess a more experienced cook. I noticed that none of their employees had name tags. So our new cook is a slender buff Asian dude. This dude never introduced himself and just began cooking our food. He was a bit better than Trainee, he seemed like he knew what he was doing and at least he utilized the air vent. \n\nWhen we ate our meats and we all agreed that it didn't have as much flavor as we are accustom too. We heard that 8ounce meats were top notch but we felt that Hobak was much better than this place. 8ounce was super expensive for the type of service and quality of sides and meats we received. Their desserts are separate which was disappointing because their are other places that offer complementary desserts. Best thing about this place is the atmosphere. It's beautiful, clean and it's very modern but it will take more than looks to bring me back. We will NOT be coming back to this place nor recommend it to our friends.

Las Vegas is famously known for its buffets. When I was in Vegas years ago, I remember the glorious Caesar's Palace buffet that my family and I ate at, so I was kind of excited to find out that we got a free buffet at the MGM Grand. Sadly, the only saving grace to this buffet was that it came with our hotel room. To any visitors looking for a buffet experience, I HIGHLY recommend that you avoid this place at all cost. I would recommend eating dropped table scraps from the MGM food court before eating at this place... yes it is that bad!\n\nThe service was pretty standard when it comes to service at any buffet. Waiter comes in and takes your drink order then you go to town on the food selection. I ended up eating some crab legs, and roast beef at my MGM buffet experience. The crab legs were very tasteless... almost like these legs were thawed from a frozen pack of pre-cooked crab legs that one can buy at their local super market. The texture of the legs was very dry and stringy. One would expect food of this quality at dormitory cafeteria buffet at any University on Tuesday nights, let alone, at Las Vegas. Not tasty at all. The roast beef was so-so. The slices were pretty small, and that beef itself was way overcooked, which lead to the meat being tough. It was a step above dormitory cafeteria food, but also a several steps below an average Golden Corral.\n\nThe desserts were better. Its like the typical desserts that you will find at any buffet, such as the self serve ice cream, premade cakes, cookies and such. But then you would expect desserts of this quality at a generic buffet, not at a Las Vegas resort and casino. If you are staying at the MGM Grand and received a free MGM buffet voucher, then by all means, eat the free food. If the only buffet experience that you have ever had was at your undergrad dorm cafeteria, a hospital buffet or at a friend's dumpster eating 3 week old Thanksgiving left overs, then this might be your place to eat, however you will get more bang for your buck at the McDonalds food court on the other side of the building.

There were no invasive questions about financing -- we did not dress the part, but no one questioned our ability to purchase a car or pushed for a less-expensive option. The negotiation was more of a discussion, absent any passive-aggressive sales tactics we had encountered at other places. Bill spoke plainly and there weren't any tactical visits from the sales manager. Two enthusiastic thumbs up for Coulter Cadillac dealer and Bill Jurczak.

The gym is two stories and full of machines.  The pool area has cabanas and looks like it's straight out of Vegas.  The decor and vibe in the leasing office is very attractive.  The location is ideal if you enjoy that part of Scottsdale and like to be within walking distance of the action.  \n\nI have lived in apartments for the majority of my adult life and for the past three years I've been living in 'luxury' apartments.  While the price is higher it's usually worth it....quieter, service is usually fast, new appliances, etc.  When we moved into Broadstone we excepted much of the same.  Unfortunately, that was not our experience.\n\nThere is a certain amount of noise that is expected when living in apartments.  Should you decide to move here know that there is no soundproofing.  We could hear our neighbors cell phone alarm go off each morning.  When our upstairs neighbor walked around we could hear every step he took, it sounded like he was stomping and then we realized it was just the build of the place.\n\nThe service response was also disappointing.  We had a cricket issue about a month before we moved out.  Everyday for a few weeks I would find a cricket somewhere in our place.  While it was annoying I certainly understood that pest issues happen.  What shocked me was the lack of response.  We would put in a work order then someone at the office would mark it as complete and leave a note saying pest control would be stopping by next week.  Pest control would then stop in, spray, and then tell me good luck.  \n\nIf anyone had pretended like they cared I probably wouldn't be mentioning it.  However, it's agitating when you are spending a pretty penny for rent and the response is one of apathy.\n\nSomething else to be aware of is that you will be splitting the utilities used in the common areas throughout the complex and the amount is not insignificant.  There are a lot of hallways to cool and there's nothing like knowing you are helping pay for the fire pit running on 100 degree nights with no one near them.\n\nApartment living always has it's challenges and different aspects are important to different renters.

We had booked the room at $88/night with Expedia a week in advance. Checking in was easy and the person was very helpful. She mentioned we were her first Dodger/spring training fans of the season so +1 for her! Our room (207) was clean and comfortable. There were obvious signs of wear and tear but not enough to make me leave. The only downsides I noticed were the noisy floors and water fixtures, AND the deal breaker was the choice in TV channels. NO ESPN! Anyway, I didn't go to watch TV, but it would have helped to catch a decent movie or show. The sink could use some upgrading but the shower head had AMAZING water pressure. Awesome room service also. We left early in the morning and came back to a spotless room!\n\nThe distance to surrounding nightlife in Tempe, Scottsdale and downtown was great, especially when we didn't have to travel far to get on the freeway. We traveled about 45 mins to each spring training facility in Phoenix and Goodyear, so remember to plan your drive accordingly. The complimentary breakfast was simple: cereal, waffles, bread and coffee. I didn't get in the pool but my son said it was freezing. So maybe wait for the scorching summer heat to jump in.

I've only owned Ford vehicles my entire life with the exception of one Chevy for about 3 months. The Bob Gillingham Ford location on Brookpark Rd. has made me question whether this American run company is taking to the ways of their competition in the East by taking advantage of its customers by not providing quality products or services.  On more than one occasion this particular location has taken advantage of my elderly father.  Two separate times , they had quoted him a price before starting the job and quoted him a higher price after the job was completed.  On one occasion they told him that he needed a part that had gone bad.  I took it to two other Ford Dealerships and they said there was no need for replacement. I feel they attempted to intimidate him into making repairs. In one instance when I stopped up to check on a repair with him I noticed that the invoice reflected a charge for a part the mechanics damaged.

The woman at the front desk was friendly and told us the room was not ready, which was fine since check-in time is technically 3pm. So we went to the buffet to eat first. (buffet is good)\n\nCame back to the front desk at 3:45pm, and different woman at the front desk told us our room was not ready. Now I'm concerned b/c check-in time is supposed to be 3pm. The woman told us check-in is between 3-5pm, which is crazy b/c no hotel does that, and that's not what it says on the website. B/c we were upset, she started getting attitude and told us the room was not ready (no explanation), that they would call us when it was ready and that there were other people waiting ahead of us for rooms. She said she had no idea when the room would be ready and was completely unconcerned that we would have to sit around the hotel and wait until god knows when for a room to be \"ready.\"\n\nWe sat around the hotel and waited until about 5:20pm, since we were told 5pm and were waiting for them to call. We were tired and tried to take naps on the couches near one of the lounges, since we had nothing else to do. Went back to the front desk around 6pm to check, b/c no one called us, and a different woman at the front desk told us our room was still not ready! She said the rooms just hadn't been cleaned yet. This one was more accommodating and understanding, so eventually she found us a room that was clean and it was an upgrade from the room we reserved. We were just grateful and giddy to finally be getting a room so we could put our things down. Especially since were only staying one night, and check-out is supposed to be 11am - I was worried we'd be sitting around all night waiting and then have to go to sleep and check out the whole rest of the trip!\n\nThe room was beautiful, huge, w/ a fantastic view. Loved it, but we just didn't have any time or energy to really enjoy it. We got into the room around 6:30pm and put our stuff down. We were so tired from the ordeal that we didn't gamble or try a restaurant like we planned. We just stumbled out to find food real quick, walk around a bit, and went to sleep. Then we had to check out at 11a the next morning. Oh, and the 3/4 bathroom had not been cleaned - there was a sucked out lime in the sink and beverages on the counter. But we were fine with that; we just didn't use that bathroom.\n\nIt's such a huge disappointment b/c I love everything about the atmosphere, decor, and location of the Cosmo, and I really thought it was going to be my favorite place in Vegas now (I come about once a month). Now I'm very cautious and reluctant to try going there again, and I'll caution everyone I know about staying there. I understand it's new and might need some time to adjust, but it's really unacceptable that people can't get into a room until 7pm. And we weren't the only ones waiting - the lobby was full of unhappy and angry people, some of whom had been waiting since 10 or 11am for a room and still didn't have one by 6:30p. When check-out is 11a and check-in is 3p, there's 4 hrs to clean rooms, and every reserved room should be clean and available by 3pm. It was a Sunday night, and not a busy weekend. I shudder to think what's going to happen next week when Chinese New Year, a UFC fight, and the Superbowl converges on Vegas! I've traveled a LOT in the past 10 yrs, and all over the world, and I've never experienced anything like this. I'm afraid to think what the service would've been like at the pool, nightclub, restaurants, spa, and gym, if I'd had the chance to utilize any of those things.\n\nI'd like to give the Cosmo another chance, maybe in a few months, and hope things improve considerably. If they do, then it'd probably be my new favorite hotel on the strip. If not, then I just can't ever go back again, no matter how nice the rooms are.

Yep, farm. So think chickens, chihuahuas, big dogs, horses, cats and a pig...mid century style. Anyway, the point is quirky...we're quirky. And Royal does a great job with us in all our \"Q\" ness. We said, mid century modern bathroom sconce, Mike said, this one...and it was perfect. We said, need kitchen pendants, vaulted ceilings , strange angles, no attic space, Philomena said, these ones...perfect again. What about a mirror, we said...well, you get the picture. Oh, by the way, we said, I broke the shade on a light like this one (pointing at ceiling), any chance of getting another? Philomena says, tell me the size and I will get you one. And then there is the payment part...a discount here and few extra LED bulbs and we are gulp, happy about parting withour credit card.Anyway, our little city trip for a sconce turned into yet another great Royal visit.

Now here we are 4 months later and I'm lucky if the doorbell doesn't have a \"remote failure\" error for more than 12 hours. I paid extra to have a garage door opener installed since I'm new to garage life and didn't want to accidentally leave my garage door open when I'm not home/sleeping. That was the biggest joke. They had to come out 3 times in the first month to \"fix\" it so I finally just asked them to uninstall it after paying $400+ in locksmith fees because I couldn't get my garage door open (I know, my bad for not having a spare key). \nNow for the actual alarm, which I pay extra for the alleged 2-way voice communication. I have tripped the alarm on accident twice. I never received a call or any sort of notification that the alarm went off. Just incredibly loud beeping. While I'm glad I didn't pay for false alarms, what happens when someone breaks in? \nI would say 50% of the time I don't have issues arming/disarming the house with the alarm.com app with up to a few minutes delay. The other 50% of the time, literally nothing happens. The arming icon will just flash forever. I frequently get \"remote communication failures\" and they conveniently happen when I'm out of town, which is when I need the security system the  most. To top it off, the have ONE customer service rep.

We will not be taking her back and would not recommend this facility to anyone for preschool.  When my daughter toured this facility, there were 20 kids in the room and 3 teachers.  When my daughter dropped my granddaughter off this morning, she said it was very chaotic and there were 25 kids and only two teachers.  When I picked up my granddaughter,  it was utter chaos and I asked the teachers how many kids there were and they told me 27.  The two teachers were quite obviously very overwhelmed.  Also, my granddaughter was crying and complaining of pain in her throat when I arrived.  She informed me that a boy punched her in the throat.  This kind of thing happens with kids, but I do believe if there were more teachers present, this would help this situation improve.  Neither of the teachers had five seconds to talk to me about what had happened in regards to this, as they were so busy trying to manage 27 kids.

After we had left the facility, I then called to speak with Sarah, who informed me that Stacey told her I yelled at her.  I would encourage them to watch any video that may be available where they will be able to see that I did not yell.  This is concerning that Stacey would tell Sarah something so untrue.  It is also concerning that they would care so little about my concerns and the obviously overwhelmed teachers.  Sarah stated to me that the state regulation is 13 kids per teacher and stated there were only 24 kids in the room.  I told her the teachers themselves told me there were 27 and I suggested that they could go above and beyond what the state requires and hire another teacher.  At that point, Sarah got very angry with me and hung up.  Again,  I most certainly would not recommend this facility as a preschool.", "stars": 1, "cool": 0, "useful": 2, "date": "2016-04-12"}, {"user_id": "6CDdHtgNZiElxAcPQLwjZw", "review_id": "NEqJmuYzz0Dzf49Oucvlyw", "funny": 0, "business_id": "Uda-CqNfow8Gh4rgtdhJZg", "text": "Italian hoagie, no capicola, asked for banana peppers there were 5 of them on the whole hoagie.
