I stayed at the Fairmont for almost a week last week on a combo business/pleasure trip. My parents met us out there for the weekend and my mother and I enjoyed a girls spa day on Saturday which consisted of a massage and facial. Initially I was nervous because I have never had a positive experience with facials. It's not that I have sensitive skin, but for some reason without fail I always break out and turn bright red for days after a facial. Regardless I decided to go for it anyways... \n\nWe arrived around 6am (can't get off east coast time) to check everything out. There is a nice fitness facility that you have access to when you use the spa (otherwise is $25/day for hotel guests to access) that we used first thing in the morning. We then went up to the rooftop pool and relaxed until our appointments. \n\nWhile I still give this spa five stars, they did make a couple of minor mistakes. We had scheduled for our massage & facials to be at 1pm, back to back. When we checked in they had us getting a massage at 1pm and facial at 6pm. Obviously that was not going to work being that we had to be at my fiance's baseball game by then... but, they fixed it... so no complaints. The second mistake was that my mother made it very clear she wanted me to have a female masseuse, and I had a male... This too ended up not being a big deal, as I could care less who gives the massage. Just mentioning it as I know that would be a deal breaker for some women. \n\nNow onto the services: \nMASSAGE: My 60 minute Swedish massage was wonderful. I had a man named Rico who has been working at the Spa for 9 years now and could not have been friendlier. The massage was excellent and I did not want it to end! \nFACIAL: I had a 45 minute Rejuvenation facial with Jaime. Honestly cannot say enough good things about her or the outcome of her facial. She was very professional (has been doing this for 14 years) and really listened to my concerns about past facials. My skin looked and felt much better immediately after the facial. I highly recommend her. \nPEDICURE: I came back on my last day to use the fitness facilities and get a pedicure. The pedicure was nice, but for $65 I'd probably not do it again. My hole in the wall places do just as good a job for much less. Either way, the woman (can't remember her name) was very nice and she did a great job. \n\nOther Highlights: They have fresh apples and a delicious lemonade available all over the place. They also provide mini muffins (yum!) in the morning and cookies in the afternoons. You may order a healthy lunch to enjoy while you are there as well. They offer lots of yoga classes and personal training in the fitness facility that looked pretty good. They also have separate lounges for men and women that have their own saunas, eucalyptus inhalation rooms and showers.", "user_id": "bJs-bBGhPW-qCwFFOKNnBw", "review_id": "cJq3HVCl-GlVSqS5VYPu7g", "cool": 1, "business_id": "vZaCTy1k35_Mi82Fsg9dkQ"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 4, "funny": 0, "date": "2010-08-12", "text": "Went here once recently and once about a year ago.\n\nAs mentioned before, they give a veritable treasure trove of banchan.

We had to wait in a long check-in line and the desk clerk told us and wrote down the wrong room number, so our keys didn't work.  The Bellman came up with our luggage and had to call downstairs to find out what was going on. We were supposed to have a room a few doors down. He let us in but we had to go back down 19 floors to the bell desk to get the right keys. I thought to myself, well if this is the worst thing that happens that's not too bad, even though I didn't see why they didn't bring up the keys themselves since they had screwed up.\n\nWe came here on a few days where there was record breaking heat for February.  The pool was closed the entire 3 days we were there but still got charged a $17.00 a night \"Resort Fee\". People were laying out in the sun in bathing suits but no one could go in the pool.\n\nThe first 24 hours:\n\nThe Deluxe two double bed room would've been fine. It wasn't too spacious, wasn't too small.  But nothing in the room worked.\n\nI couldn't program the safe, it kept giving me an error code. I had to call security up to fix it. I have never had any problems in other hotels I've stayed with safes. Had to wait for security to fix it.\n\nI noticed it was hot in the room and went to turn the a/c on. I saw a wrench icon blinking. The a/c was not working, had to call maintenance and have them fix it.\n\nThe TV remote didn't work most of the time, couldn't see if it needed new batteries, it was completely sealed. It would only work if you were standing about a foot away from the TV, so you couldn't even use it from the beds that it was right in front of.  Even in front of the TV the remote wouldn't work sometimes.\n\nThe WIFI only had 4 bars and would cut you off or wouldn't connect at all.\n\nThe shower drain was clogged. had to call maintenance again to unclog it.\n\nCalled the front desk to complain, They said they would upgrade us to a Deluxe One bedroom suite with two beds for free and it would be ready by 1:30 pm.  The Riviera had told me they guarantee all their rooms to be ready by 4 pm, but we spent nearly the whole day until after 4 pm waiting for the room to be \"cleaned\". We were starving and had to leave to eat once.\n\n2nd & 3rd days:\n\nSuite was nice and spacious. WIFI was non-existent, even though it showed 4 to 5 bars. One bedside lamp didn't work and curtain puller was broken. View was of the side of hotel and Circus Circus.\n\nWe had a DO NOT DISTURB sign on our door yet someone still knocked the next morning. TWICE.\n\nWe were leaving around 1 or 2 pm for the day and I called and specifically asked for maid service while we were gone.  I called Housekeeping directly, told them we would be gone but would like maid service. They said someone would be right over.  I left a tip in the gratuity envelope for the maid and placed it on the bar.  When we came back later that evening, the room hadn't been touched. Beds unmade, trash not emptied, etc.  I took the gratuity back out of the envelope and left a note that said basically \"I called housekeeping and no one ever showed up so no tip for you\". \n\nOne of the toilets kept running in the suite. I just got up and jiggled the handle, because it was loud. This happened a few times.\n\nThe night before we were going to leave, the safe we had been using with no problems for 2 days suddenly decided to throw up an error code with our valuables locked inside.  I had to wait for security to come up and bypass it again.\n\nThe valet and the bellmen were all nice. They received tips.\n\nThe lady at the fast food Mexican restaurant downstairs looked angry at the world and the food wasn't that great.  Wicked Vicky's was ok but too expensive for what you got.\n\nOn the day of checkout, I called the Bell Desk for help with our luggage and the bellman told me there was no one to check us out at the front desk. So I checked out over the TV system, and it said an e-mail would be sent to me. It didn't ask for an e-mail address so I assumed they meant the one they had sent 3 different confirmations to when I made the reservation.\n\nWhen I returned home there was no e-mail. I called the hotel and they said they sent it to some e-mail that was close to mine but it was not right.  How is it they could send me 3 different e-mails before our arrival, yet screw up our e-mail address upon departure? I am wondering now if my credit card will be charged correctly as the charges are still \"pending\".\n\nI can live with a few inconveniences, I do all the time.

We ultimately chose Lyons (even though they came in at a higher price) because they seemed more thorough and knowledgeable than the other company that came to inspect the roof. The initial interactions with Lyons were very pleasant and the actual roof replacement went well. At the time we replaced the roof we knew we might be selling our house in the very near future and would need to transfer the warranty. Normally that process comes with a $150 \"transfer fee\" but one of the project managers told my wife that that fee could be waived if the transfer was going to be so soon after the roof replacement.\n\nIt was during the sale of our house that Lyons' ugly side showed up. The buyer's inspector noted a few issues with the replaced roof. They were mostly minor - but failed inspection nonetheless. We began the transfer process with Lyons and informed them of the issues - even sent them a copy of the inspection report. Despite having that report for more than a week, the person they sent to our house to do the transfer inspection appeared clueless as to the repairs that had to be made. So they had to send someone else out a few days later. Ultimately, we probably had to call Lyons people over to our house 3-4 more times because each time they failed to do the necessary repairs or argued with us about what had to be done. We had spent $12,000 on our new roof, but apparently were no longer valued customers after they believed they had \"finished\" the job. \n\nUltimately they made us pay the $150 transfer fee, even though we were previously told it would be waived. When it was paid, we requested an invoice the same day so that we could give proof of payment to the buyers so as not to hold up our house sale. So of course Lyons' office staff left for the day without doing that. Lyons' terrible customer service nearly singlehandedly delayed our home sale because they took FOREVER to do simple tasks, argued with us every step of the way, and would not even provide us with the documentation we requested. We were valuable to Lyons up until the point that we wrote them a $12,000 check.

She couldn't believe that Jack got EVERYTHING out! She said \"It looks brand new!\". But' it gets even better because... The very day I called him he drove 40 miles to come & look at my carpeting!!! Who is this guy - same day service, nice, prompt, well groomed & yes, he is happy! Anyway, this carpet is in a rental I own and the renter was in there for 7 years. He moved in with 3 boys and periodically moved his brother (& his brother's kids) in and out and a few years ago, he remarried. Did I mention that the bride had 2 teenagers? Woops, almost forgot the dog! In all that time, they never cleaned the carpet. So, now they are gone & I really thought that nothing could be done for the poor, abused carpeting & that I should just put it out of its misery. It truly was utterly disgusting.  But Jack said he was sure he could hugely improve it, and the price he quoted me was so unbelievable that I figured I had to give it a try. So today he showed up & told me to give him about 3 hours, so I left to run errands. When I came back 3 hours later he wasn't quite done so I left again. Altogether it took him 4 hours BUT I absolutely know that it was because the carpet was so horrid & he was determined to transform it. Did he complain? Give up? Ask me for more money? No, no and no. He just worked his tail off till it was done and done superbly. I was truly amazed at what I came home to. I actually wrote him a check for MORE than the agreed upon price because he doesn't even charge enough in the first place! Then to top it off he completely floors me (floors me - get it? LOL). I had forgotten what color the carpeting actually was and it was sooooo clean & fresh that I secretly was wondering if somehow he had magically installed new carpeting while I was gone (I watch all that conspiracy theory stuff). I am so grateful that there are still businesses around that have these kind of work ethics and integrity and I hope he gets a TON of business and becomes very rich & blessed because he really, really deserves that.

Very few employees in character, there is no spontaneous wild west action because all shows are scheduled and cost, the shops are modernized, and there is little to see and do. The sweet shop has delicious fudge and chocolates but has lost all of it's old west charm and has given into commercialized brands. There really is no consideration given to capturing and maintaining the Old West Rawhide.\nWe went to the Blue Collar Beerfest & Backyard BBQ, which in itself was a disgrace to the beer and BBQ world. (One BBQ food truck and I will spare you the tacky beer details) There was no country music, grunge rock bands played. Even in the saloon they were playing top rock hits! While I love rock music, it was not befitting to the supposed theme of Rawhide. There were even timeshare vendors and massage chair kiosks set-up in the town! We ate in the steak house since the BBQ selection was minimal and the line was extremely long, about 40 plus. My fiance had to return his \"smoked\" chicken because it was very mushy. There was no hint of smoke to the chicken, it was in the sauce. He did enjoy the sides though. The salad and rolls reminded me of cafeteria food. Yucky...However, my prime rib was as good as I remember it though and the waiter was great. I was happy to see some of the artifacts from the old brought here to the new location, like the bar and saloon entrance.\nWe will not return.

I worked at a steak and prime rib house for many years where the executive chef was a CIA graduate, so maybe I am being overly critical. That said, here we go. \n\nWe ate there on the evening of 22 August 2015. \n\nWhen we entered, the three of us were seated in the bar section on swivel stools without ever being asked if we wanted to sit in the restaurant proper or in the very loud and raucous bar area. Maybe the main dining room was full because of reservations?  No, this place stayed half-full all night. \n\nThat said, the restaurant's layout is fairly pleasing and it is clean.  \n\nAfter we were shown to our seats, we got to wait about 15-20 minutes without any of the staff so much as looking in our direction. When I finally went to the hostess station and explained that we were interested in ordering drinks and food, I was given three menus and an apology.  We then got multiple staff coming over to ask if we had menus, although none of them turned out to be our waitress.  \n\nOur waitress took another five minutes to come over and introduce herself.  She wanted to start us on wine before we'd discussed any food options, and said that she was fairly knowledgable on a good glass of red. Based on her language, I am taking a wild guess that she was trained as neither a wine stewardess or wine waitress. \n\nWhen we did finally get served, we got to experience what seemed to be something out of some kind of bad foodie movie:  sparkling water bottles being opened and nearly hitting my wife in the face (twice!), ordering prime rib and getting butter knives (we had to request steak knives), the (chintzy)steak knives being dropped by my wife so fast we all (waitress included) jumped because it nearly cut her hand, food coming out without the sides (we all ordered the exact same thing), etc. \n\nAs for the food, I'd say mediocre at best. French onion soup and Caesar salad dressing were over salted, the prime rib cuts were very stringy, and the waitress' visits were too sporadic to make any major positive impact.  \n\nOverall, this place looks like it is aspiring to be a great steakhouse with a modern feel, but until they work out the kinks I wouldn't come here unless I was getting some free food or I didn't have any easily other accessible food options. \n\nIf you aren't picky about the quality of your food and are willing to pay prime rib prices for flank steak quality, then you can give this place a try to see if you disagree with me.

At 9:12 they called us and had two tables across the room from each other, that was not what she said and that was not an option since I had young children. She then said about 25 minutes more for the wait, we said ok and at 9:25 they called for a party of 10 that was seated all together. This party only waited 20 min and was seated. We spoke to the manager who admitted when we declined the tables across the room the POS system placed us back on the bottom of the list and the hostess should of realized that we should have been seated before the party of 10. He asked what he could do to make this right and my husband asked for a discount. The manager said he would do the best he can. We were finally seated at 9:50, service was fine although the waiter took our food order immediately and apologized for our inconvenience but forgot to get our drink order. When our bill came no discount was taken we spoke to the General Manager and asked about our discount, he responded by saying you were seated 11 min past the time told why would we discount. Never mind that your hostess misinformed us, never mind that you seated a large party like ours first, never mind everything that transpired during our hour and 20 min wait. All he cared about was that we were seated 11 min past the time we were promised. If we were seated 11 min past our time that would of been at 9:31 from the original 50 minutes we were told.", "user_id": "J4jbbXh9W5-1jTbJM14Dng", "review_id": "88K2K-6823sqgyvz0QwVtQ", "cool": 0, "business_id": "XQJr9_jZR1vOoZVcZfDDwQ"}, {"useful": 11, "stars": 3, "funny": 0, "date": "2009-09-23", "text": "I'm rather undecided about this place.

He was friendly and helpful when I dropped my tables off and was just as friendly, even remembering our conversation, 3.5 months later when I picked them up. Unfortunately, none of the services provided aside from that were acceptable in any way.\u00a0\n\n\nI moved to town in January and had 2 tiny antique wood tables I wanted refinished. I went to Yelp and Google for reviews before choosing a place and picked this business based on the reviews alone. The location is very inconvenient but it was worth it for quality work, so I dropped these tables off in early January with no rush to get them done.\u00a0\n\n\nLast week I received an emailed invoice and a message that the tables were ready (3.5 months... 2 tiny wood tables). The first catch was the cost being higher than the \"high quote\" I was given in January (which I raised back then as being rather high and questioning the hours estimated). The bill issued- $727 to glue all the joints, sand, and stain the 2 tables the same shade- much, much darker than the original. This is key because there was no paint to strip, nor did the sanding or stripping need to be perfect for a lighter stain. And there is no details on these tables; they are both very simple lines and plainly constructed. The job wasn't difficult in the least.\u00a0\n\n\nI was immediately irritated and asked for details about the invoice, within minutes of receiving it, because it was so high for such simple work on truly tiny, basic tables. The first reply (also within minutes) was that the quote was correct. When I didn't email again right away another email from the same person said they would inquire further about the cost and hours worked on the job by the guys who did the work. I replied the same day that I'd appreciate that detail and that I'd be in today to get the tables. And... days pass but no update or details about the invoice.\n\n\nI make a special trip out to pick up the tables today, fully expecting that for $700 and 3.5 months, these tables will be expertly refinished. I'm still irritated at the cost but am optimistic about the quality. Running to do this errand before heading to work, I'm in a hurry and in no mood to argue the invoice, handed to me without any of the promised details and not adjusted in the least. It was as though I'd not even raised the issue previously and I wasn't going to argue it then. I wrote a check for the balance (they don't take cards in 2018) and the friendly guy helped me the load the tables into my car. I did not inspect them then; it's almost an hour drive from the shop to my office and nothing was amiss at first glance in my hurry to get to work.\u00a0\n\n\nAs shown in the photos, my $700 refinishing job has large, obvious drips in the stain/gloss on both tables. There are fingerprints in the stain on one, thin spots showing through the old stain on both, thick and visible glue underneath (but not finished edges- because to stain the edges takes so much longer?), and VERY visible, deep staple holes in multiple places. There were no such holes on these tables before and it's clear that they didn't care enough to seal the holes after placing the staples through the exterior of the joints. The sealant was either too thick or not applied well (honestly not sure which because I didn't inspect the tables until I got home tonight) but in any event has already chipped off corners on both edges of the table placed in the fully carpeted cargo area of my car on the ride home.\u00a0\n\n\nThe overall effect is that $700 and 3.5 months later, I have to fix or have fixed by someone else, the numerous places where this refinishing work fails. I'm speechless at how blatantly poor the quality and for a seriously premium price, and I'm beyond frustrated there is no remedy for service issues like this. Poor products you can return, but poor service you're just stuck paying to subsidize. I will not be returning to this business and I can't recommend it to anyone, for any purpose.

I didn't have time to wait for it to be remade so I asked for just the sandwiches. The gentleman working on the kitchen said the sandwiches she grabbed for me were for a call in customer. She ignored him and rang me up. \n\nInitially she said $25...for 3 gyros!! When I questioned the price, she rerang them and said $22.

On paper, Bacio seemed to fit the bill, but honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and the service as well!\n\nBacio is an Italian restaurant located in the Tropicana, between the casino and the Club Tower/Convention area.  Its located right on an interior walkway, so you have the option to sit \"outside\" and get some stellar people watching in, or you can sit inside the cozy little restaurant and have a more quiet, intimate meal.  We opted for the latter.  Before you come to Bacio, make sure you sign up for the Trop Rewards card... you get a lower price on everything on the menu (only a dollar, but still), and a free glass of wine with the purchase of an entr\u00e9e.  I had the house Chardonnay and it was surprisingly good!\n\nOur waitress was a very attentive server but not intrusive.  I wish I could remember her name, she was super nice. The complimentary bread arrived with oil and balsamic vinegar, but I did not partake as my husband deemed it \"average\" and I'm not one to fill up on average bread! We started with the calamari appetizer, which came with marinara and aioli dipping sauces.  The breading was light and bound well to the calamari, but it could have used a little seasoning.  Next came a Caesar salad, which they were kind enough to split into 2 plates for us.\n\nFor our entrees, we were both in the mood for seafood.  I ordered the Capesante, pan seared scallops served over risotto with asparagus and crispy prosciutto, and my husband had the Capellini, which was shrimp over angel hair pasta with a garlic butter sauce.  The Capellini was a little bland, could have used a little more garlic or maybe some crushed red pepper, but the shrimp were large and cooked very well.  My risotto was creamy and delicious, the scallops were HUGE and cooked perfectly, and crispy prosciutto is never a bad addition to a dish.  I would have a hard time going back to Bacio and not ordering the Capesante! \n\nThere are so many great places to eat in Las Vegas, but if you are staying at or near the Tropicana and looking for a good Italian meal, I would definitely recommend Bacio.", "user_id": "qk4wCmW33NL7YfiRIaa4WQ", "review_id": "vlk-IV9ciP4cc5BGRf34lw", "cool": 0, "business_id": "s2X_2ri_9Krm0xuciKCR-Q"}, {"useful": 1, "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "date": "2017-04-07", "text": "Dr. Bhatt is fantastic!

Would have liked it more if it was a little more spicy (pretty much not spicy the way it is now).\n\nThe worst Pad Thai ($12) I've had in my life. The noodles were extremely soft and undercooked. The sauce was like tomato sauce but not sour, unsweet, and not spicy - a very bland taste. The shrimps were very overcooked and tasted gross. I highly do not recommend the pad thai here.\n\nI would be back for the vermicelli and to try the pho, but definitely not the pad thai.", "user_id": "qr06IGEdVEIQmyv-NZe-og", "review_id": "dvT6nKcXj1F6NGqjl8lPMw", "cool": 2, "business_id": "YAgoRzc92vC3cHc-RrlSSA"}, {"useful": 1, "stars": 4, "funny": 0, "date": "2011-11-03", "text": "This place is owned by Luigi (see Luigi's Pizza  http://www.yelp.com/biz/luigis-pizza-charlotte-3 ) and its a pretty cool place. \n\nThe food was great, the service was excellent and the prices were fair.

There were four of us, and we arrived we were forced to wait which was rather confusing because the restaurant was pretty empty.  Anyway, we only had to wait for about 10 minutes, so no big deal. Except, because the place was pretty empty we thought we'd get a good table with a view.  Not so much.  We got a booth facing the middle of the place.  whatever, no problem,  the view wasn't that important to us.  \n\nI forget our waiter's name but he was really helpful and a funny dude.  He helped us pick a bottle of wine ( I don't remember what it was, but it was pretty cheap and really good).  For aps, we ordered Crudo (kinda like a sashimi dish) , Arancino (rissotto ball),  crab cakes.  We had one more, but I forget what it was, prob a seafood dish.  Everbody really liked their aps, and my Arancino was fantastic.  We also ordered a bowl of Sunday Gravy (pasta, meatballs) for everyone to split.  The waiter was really cool and told us we only need half of it, and gave us a half portion, and everyone loved the Sunday Gravy.  Even the half portion was huge.  Oh, I forgot, the breads they served us before the aps were really good too.   \n\nOn to the dinners, I was kind of boring and got the chicken parm.  It was the best chicken parm Ive ever had in my life, hands down.  The portion was also HUGE!.  I also had the garlic mashed potatoes which were good, a lil on the strong side. I felt horrible throwing it out, because it was just that good.  My friend ordered their specialty, the osso bucco, which was perfect.\n\nWe def ordered way too much food, and realized we could have probably eaten here for very cheap.

It was only a couple weeks after it opened and my god, the line is ridiuclously long! I came around 6:00 hoping that the line wouldn't be too bad but upon my arrival, the line was snaking around like it was Disneyland or something.\n\nNot only was the line super long but the it was moving ridiculously slowwwww. I swear I was standing in the same place for at least 10 minutes before moving an inch. -_- I'm normally a patient person but just the way the line was moving it was going to take at least 2+ hours just to get seated.  After about a good 45 minutes, I said F*CK it and I decided to shell out the extra $15 bucks per person for the express.  Thankfully, NO ONE was at there and I literally got seated within 5 minutes. \n\nSo, besides paying $50+ per person for this meal, I actually had a GREAT time! I immediately saw all the different selections and my mood quickly turned from hangry (hungry + angry) to super happy! (sappy?) Anyways, when you first arrive inside, you'll notice the long selection of seafood in the front.  I was quite impressed with all the mussels, oysters, and crabs that you get to choose from.  There is a guy in the back who can steam them for you too if you're not a fan of raw seafood.  At first, I thought that was pretty much it but I quickly learned that the buffet stretched allllllll the way down the room.  It was a non-stop line of food! I was very impressed with their selection.\n\nEverything tasted amazing! Well, everything except their pizza. I know, why would I get pizza at a fancy buffet like Bacchanal when they have steak and seafood?! I really enjoyed my meal.  I would say it was TOTALLY worth spending that extra $15.  Ceviche? Bomb. Lobster bisque? Bomb.  Crab fritters? ALL BOMB.  The bf also really liked many of their selections as well.  Definitely try a little bit of everything.  You'll find a mass amount of food here that you'll like. \n\nI think Caesar's did a great job of making sure that they offered a vast selection of food for their buffet.

I don't know what the bartender did different with the mojito, but it was the best I ever had, and even the server told me that it was one of the best! It was a bit small, but worth every penny.\nWe started off with fried rock shrimp and picked carrots and radish (kind of an asian flavor to it) in a lettuce cup with a caviar vinaigarette. The rock shrimp was seasoned just right, and I just picked up the lettuce cup and ate the whole thing like a wrap. Both the hubby and I loved it. \nThen we had a broiled oyster that was not so good. It was cooked with a creamy sauce with onions, the sauce was good, but I hit a chunk of shell on my first bite, and that ruined it for me. \nThe pan cooked salmon on a black-eyed peas/yams salad was okay. The salmon was a little tough, but the crunchy salad had an interesting texture and tangy flavor to it that added a few points to the fish.\nThe black cod with mixed mushrooms and a wheat-berry vegetable melange was awesome. The mixed mushrooms were cooked together in a sherry or wine sauce, yet retained their individual flavors. The cod was tender and went with the sides quite well.\nThe filet was juicy but the shrimp on top was a little over-seasoned. The bleu cheese was a nice touch, but you have to be careful to taste just a teensy bit with the food, or it easily overpowers the meat.\nThe dessert, bread pudding with warm cream and whisky reduction was heaven. When I told the server the bread pudding was awesome, he smiled and confessed that it was his favorite of all times.\n\nThe husband liked the wine pairing, though most of it were white wines (for the seafood), and he's not a fan of white wines.", "user_id": "APoNFkpWx0HkQN2lcGXOEQ", "review_id": "cX2ctOB8PmvUrgz5poJU-A", "cool": 0, "business_id": "BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 4, "funny": 0, "date": "2016-02-12", "text": "I just got finished with my first class at OTF and I loved it!

Brutally bad, which I never expected.  \n\n(One star because of expectations based on price point and location.)\n\nWhat do they sell here - heavily?  THE VIEW.  So, what are you paying for here?  THE VIEW.  The food is almost second.  On their website, what do they show you?  THE VIEW.  They show pictures and pictures of the gorgeous views of the fountains.  Um, you're not sitting by the fountains - not even close and they're super snobby about it, like there's some secret way to get it.  It's bait and switch because you literally have no chance of getting that view here at dinner... yet, that's their main selling point (and people who get it stay longer than two hours).  We checked in at 6:45 and they saw it notated that I requested the fountain view.  The hostess (who never smiled once), knowing it was requested in my reservation, callously said it would be another two hours if we wanted that, knowing we were there for a 6:45 dinner and, what, we're just going to walk around for two hours?  Then I would have made a 4:45 reservation, if that was the case.  Instead... what view did we get?  The view of the planter in the back corner, and windows with drapes blocking any kind of view through the umbrellas outside.  We were laughing about how bad of a view it was.  (I'm attaching a picture in this review.)  \n\nI hate to keep harping on it because, with sitting near a view of ANY kind, this place just looks exactly like the Cheesecake Factory decor.  If I want to a Cheesecake Factory experience, I would have gone there for 1/3 of the price... for the same views and probably better food.  We were also laughing because of how loud it was, as we were by some interior waiter station, clanging cups and broken glasses... the soundtrack for the little bit of the fountain we could kind see.\n\nAlso, I was completely over-dressed with a suit and no tie.  People are in here with shorts and t-shirts.  What!?  There's no jacket policy?  Or, at least a collared shirt?  It's farm town tourist central here.  I expected this to be along the lines of SW Steakhouse and it's not even close, as far as class.   \n\nOur waitress was awful.  Just an older lady who tried covering up a bad attitude with a teeth-gritting fake smile.  Her lack of knowledge of the menu was astonishing.  We asked about a couple wines and if it was dry or sweet or whatever and she just kinda repeated what we were saying, like, it can't be both.  Any other place, the waiter/waitress would have brought out a couple samples.  Not with her. \n\nThe food.  I ordered a Greek salad and gnocchi, with a Riesling.  The bread and olives were great... I love olives and they have various kinds and spreads.  All great.  The salad was good, again, with olives.  The entree of the gnocchi?  Sloppy mess. Dry, overcooked chicken.  Soupy.  Random mess.  I ate half of it then just gave up.  Brutal.  How do you screw up gnocchi?   \n\nKind of sad when the bread and spread far exceeds the entree.  \n\nThe only thing upscale about this place is price point... nothing else justifies it.  It is NOT a \"fine\" dining experience.  Trust me, if you want a nice night out... go to ANYTHING at the Wynn because you what you \"think\" you're getting here... is exactly what you get there.  I've been to a number of places there and all were great, especially with the water view.  Just a different vibe, better service, etc.  The ONLY reason to come here would be the view and there's apparently some super secret way to get it... which I do not know of.  \n\nObviously I had, what I assume to be, an \"outlier\" experience, basically, the worst possible experience one could have but I'd never risk giving it another shot... so there won't be a follow-up review.

Not until I arrived did I realize that I surprisingly had the joint bookmarked---solely off of the stellar Yelp reviews causing it to pop up as one of Madison's best. *embarrassed*\nChicken Lips is literally just a minute or so drive outside of Sun Prairie's downtown on the side of a road among cornfields.  I don't know if I would consider it a restaurant.  It's more of a bar run out of a dude's (named Steve) first floor of his two-story house.  Think \"Man Cave\" or \"Bachelor Pad\" lacking any luxury, where \"boys can be boys.\"  There are TVs, a pool table, arcade games, a side door that opens up to a tent for smokers, some nasty piss-ridden bathrooms.  If only Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives actually visited true dives, this is what I'd picture, except they only specialize in chicken wings, not much else...  There's a bulletin menu at the bar, which is where you also order.  As someone who is not a fan of spice and on a non-fried food cleanse diet, I became 'that' guy that the neighboring table of 30-somethings picked on.  They kept reminding me while in their drunk stupor, \"You gotta get the wings.\"  I still ended up ordering a burger which was not very enjoyable and overcooked.  Nonetheless, the rest of my party ordered the infamous Wings.  You get your choice of Dry Rub (what it's all about: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chicken-lips-sun-prairie?select=xOFL05ID2XQU28ycv_wtzQ#NgrDOJ2ui4MlKh1-IVnOYg) or Original \"Buffalo\" wings.  Both come with a tasty side of homemade blue cheese dressing dip.  I could eat the entire cup of dip with just carrots and celery simple due to the fact that is has chunks of blue cheese hidden up in there!  Of course, I reminded myself, \"When in Sun Prairie, do as a Wisconsiner would\" and bit into each type of wing.  Without the dressing, the dry wings were admittedly the best wings I have ever had---freshly fried, full of meat, and extremely tasty.  Can't say I'd be back, if so it would definitely be take-out since I'm too prissy for a dive like this.  I will concur, the word on the street is right, they cook up some killer chicken wings!\n\nNote: Before you leave, be sure to take a moment to absorb the glory of the bar and grill's name \"CHICKEN LIPS\" and the light-up sign picturing a rooster holding a martini: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chicken-lips-sun-prairie?select=xOFL05ID2XQU28ycv_wtzQ#xOFL05ID2XQU28ycv_wtzQ.

I don't typically frequent the Parkdale area, however I had found a deal for this restaurant on the website TeamBuy.ca (spend $12 get $30), and who am I to pass up a good deal? ;-)\n\nI had checked the ratings on Yelp prior to signing up for the deal, and noted that they were sort of all over the map. I decided that it was best in this case to come to my own conclusions.\n\nAs I didn't come for weekend brunch, I can't comment on whether or not the prior reviews from Lauren M or Justice D were accurate.  What I can say is that the service was excellent (that could be due to the fact that there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, so the manager could devote her attention to us), and that the food was delivered rather promptly (we were in and out in little more than an hour).\n\nWhile the menu isn't huge, it does have some eclectic concoctions, some of which have already been mentioned by prior reviewers.  As I don't eat pork, and am not down with goat cheese, it limited my choices somewhat. I chose to go with the vegan quesadilla's ($8) (it had a base of curried squash with spinach and tofu) with the side of greens ($3). The quesadilla's were tasty, however they only provided a portion of 3 wedges, which seemed rather small. I could have used one more slice. Further, the contents seemed rather paltry. The greens were tossed in a vinaigrette, however, $3 seemed pricey given the fact that it was just lettuce. I would have chosen the sweet potato fries, however that was ($6) and seemed a bit much for a side portion.\n\nMy cousin chose the brisket panini and the potato latkes.

Really enjoyed the cauliflower and the dipping sauce\nSliders - really simple beef sliders w/o cheese, tasty despite just being beef, lettuce, and tomato\nChicken w/ brie and pear mini-sandwich - the French bread it was on was too tough so I removed the bread and fork/knifed this one. It was just ok and could use more brie.\nShoestring fries - tasty! I wanted to eat more but didn't want to look like the pig that I am in front of my co-workers\nVeggie panini - i got a biteful of grilled zucchini only, no real flavors\nFruit for dessert - it was fresh, can't really mess it up otherwise\nMini chocolate cake - tasty and just the right sized bite\n\nLunch:\nI got the kahlua pork tostadas, which was a good portion and had tasty kahlua pork.  Maybe a little salty, but that was balanced out with the tortilla and the cabbage slaw w/ tomatoes and queso fresco.\n\nThe food was overall ok, though some misses (hummus, chicken/veggie sandwiches), but service is what brings this place down.  Seriously clueless hostess and servers who ignore you but try to be uber-friendly when they finally come around.  I never really saw my server but the guys in suits were always willing to help out.  It just seemed like the service was not coordinated at all.\n\nI'd recommend for lunch but make sure to allot more time than anticipated for this place.\n\nI saw a (drunk) couple complaining about having to wait way too long to get their take-out order.

I apologize for this long review but I feel like it is necessary to fully explain the situation.  My wife and I were out of town on we got a frantic phone call on Sunday from our daughter who was home alone.  She was panicking about the sprinkler system main feed line and antiphon valve blowing up and water was shooting 12 feet into the air.  Luckily, I told her where my big, T-bar wrench was and to call the neighbor over to help her turn off the main water from the street.  She and the neighbor were able to do this, but my sprinkler main feed is directly connected to the main line from the street so when they turned the water off, she also had no water feeding the house.\n\nSo I told her to use the yellow pages and call any emergency plumber to come cap off the pipe and to then turn the main water back on.....I would do the pernament repairs myself when I got home.  She called four plumbers and none were answering so she left voicemail messages with all.  Mark, from Sun Valley Plumbing, called back in about 45 minutes and came over.  When he arrived I asked to speak with him via cell phone and he told me what he saw and I explain to him how the sprinkler system was hooked directly to the main water feed.  So I asked him to just cap off the broken pipe and I would do the repairs later.  I also asked him to turn the main valve back on when he was done with the repairs so my daughter would have water in the house again.  He said \"no problem\" and fixed the problem within 20 minutes (so says my daughter).  And he only charged us $150 for this Sunday, emergency call.

Why? One reason is definitely the parking. This Y actually has a lot YMCAers can use that's right by the gym that's easily access throughout the day.  As a result, getting in and out of this YMCA takes significantly less time than other gyms.  It also is much much less crowded than the Dowd or Uptown/Childress Klein YMCA, likely because it has no pool or gym.  This YMCA also has  great group exercise classes. Meredith's Turbokick class is really incredible and, for me, sets the bar for all other aerobic classes at other Ys. The room for the spinning classes is a little dingy, but it is private and generally has good instructors. My only complaint is that this gym doesn't have more exercise classes because the facility here, while small, is much more pleasant than at the other YMCAs. It is also a little more difficult to get to from Uptown than the Childress Klein YMCA, which is a shame because I would much rather work out here. Instead, it tends to be a better before and after work gym.  Also, it isn't usually open on Sunday, which is unfortunate. \n\nAlso, because this gym is so close to Johnson and Wales, there tends to be a lot of younger folks here.

We waited in line for a total of exactly one hour from 12:20 to 1:20 p.m.\n\nThere was a long hallway into KR which also shared the space with a Japanese dessert cafe, Saryo Tokyo Cafe & Dessert.  I wish KR organized their line-ups better and in an organized fashion.  The entrance to both the ramen restaurant and dessert cafe had a small vestibule between the main door and the second door (probably used to keep out the wind) where people were waiting in line before we could actually go into the restaurant to join the line-up. \n\nAs it was a cold day, we were told by a staff member who kept coming up to the door to tell us to keep the second door closed. However, this meant that it was unclear on who was actually \"next\" in line for those standing in that little vestibule because once the second door opened, we tried to enter through the door if there was space to get in line for the ramen.  However, it didn't help that it was lunch time and a certain patron was cranky about people \"butting\" in front of her. It certainly didn't give off a very good impression of the line-up process at KR.\n\nWhen we finally got past the awkward waiting part of the vestibule and were actually in the line, we heard the hostess calling out names for parties to be seated. We heard \"Jon for 2!\" or \"Ann for 3!\" and I felt immediately anxious because we hadn't given our names or given a place in the line at all.  We had been waiting all along though. What if other people had gone in front of us to get their name in the list and we weren't on it because we were just simply waiting in the line?  Thus I walked up to the front of the line to inquire. The people who were at the front of the line informed me that I had to put my name down with the hostess who was carrying the clipboard.  Okay... so how come no one told us that then? So I walked over to the female hostess who was holding a clipboard to ask her about putting my name in the list.  She wasn't very pleasant because she sternly told me to return to the line and that she'd approach me about putting my name down on the list once she got to me. Again, it didn't make for a polite nor good first impression of the restaurant.\n\nWe continued waiting in line. It took another couple of minutes before we saw the hostess finally asking people in front of us and down the line what their names were and putting their party numbers down. Finally! Finally we were put in place on the list (and given a menu to look at while we continued waiting in line). Why couldn't she have done that sooner to ease the frustration from waiting in a line that could easily have been misconstrued by the hoards of people waiting around? They definitely should organize their line-ups better.\n\nLike I said, it took us a full hour of waiting before we were called in for a seat.  We got a table near the wall in the middle of the room. I was surprised that the seating wasn't cramped inside.  I liked the decor.\n\nOur bowls of ramen came out surprisingly fast! I found that the staff were overly nice and friendly.\n\nI got the Mild Shio Signature Clam Broth Ramen which had sous-vide chashu (pork), porcini mushroom sauce, white truffle oil, diced arugala, pea shoot, basil and red onion, braised bamboo shoot, leek, and pancetta to garnish.  \n\nI appreciated that the menu actually taught us how to enjoy the clam broth ramen in four steps.  I really liked the signature clam broth! It was so light and refreshing.  It was so much lighter than any other ramen broth I've had before (since those are usually made with pork instead).  Upon nearing the bottom of the bowl, I definitely tasted the saltiness/ocean feel of the clams too.  Since the soup was made with clams, it was also not fatty at all (also a rarity among most ramen broths)!\n\nI liked the ramen!  They were fine and grainier than most ramen noodles and tasted very light and fresh. The sous-vide chashu was very thin in texture and smooth.  It wasn't heavy either.  I liked the bowl overall and the portion was just enough for me.\n\nThe Vegetarian Ramen included the house-made creamy potato soy milk soup base with roasted corn, yams, pickled beets, tofu nuggets, mushroom, spinach, and olive oil.  The ingredients made it a really colourful bowl and the white soup base definitely stood out against the veggies. I liked the soup base as it was so creamy and milky. It was actually even more flavourful than my Shio broth.  I tried the pickled beet too and it was hard in texture but very sour and indeed pickled. The tofu nugget was mushy and tiny. \n\nI liked KR overall and the quality of the ramen and soup bases.  I would definitely want to return and try their other bowls. I just hope that next time I won't have to line up for an hour and that they have an improved organized way of getting their guests in a logical line-up.", "user_id": "jwctwzboGhQmtC50Juxa9A", "review_id": "p3fsNJ0jtbfS_WX4iUfFOA", "cool": 0, "business_id": "yg_A_TpYkJjr1fef0J6QkQ"}, {"useful": 1, "stars": 4, "funny": 0, "date": "2011-12-28", "text": "Went there today as a result of so many good reviews on Yelp.

We paid good money for VIP Tickets w/ a bar card and guaranteed access in. There was a line but it went swiftly with little to no problems (minus the bouncer thinking my ID was fake). Once inside we were pointed up stairs to the rooftop bar. I'm not sure how safe several flights of stairs are in a place where everyone is drinking and women are wearing heel but whatever. The rooftop was nice and not to crowded but once inside the \"Heart\" of OMNIA you couldn't even move. I was literally pressed against the wall with no room to move or dance. When security and staff came through to make room for dancers/bottle service girls they were shoving people out of the way. I understand that the more people are let in the more money the club makes but if there were an emergency there would be no way to get out and soooo many people would be injured or worse. There was no way we were going to make it half way around the club to get to the bar so we ended up going back to the roof. We stayed up their for the rest of the night and COMPLETELY missed Calvin Harris, which is the whole reason we paid so much money in the first place!

Earthy and flavorful, the beet salad was also a winner. Be sure that you enjoy beets though!

I would say the best item I found to be was the mapo tofu, which was perfectly soft and was not too overpowering.

Extremely average but very aesthetically pleasing to the eye.

I didn't think any of their dishes deserved significant praise.. Their presentation was amazing though, those perfect prisms of sushi are so cute.\n\nIt is a noticeably smaller place, could be because of the darker space or the symmetrical layout.. regardless, this works in their favour because their service speed is excellent!! They were quick (almost instant) to confirm our iPad orders, and our dishes (appetizers, grilled items, sushis and all) came within 5-10 minutes, no kidding.

I'm such a fan that my fianc\u00e9 actually proposed to me at a Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s restaurant, the wonderful \u00e9 by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s!\n\nOk, now that I've prefaced how much I enjoy Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s restaurants, I need to say how royally disappointing my experience at Bazaar Meats was this past weekend.  My friends and I were in Vegas to celebrate my fianc\u00e9's birthday and naturally, the consensus was to go to Bazaar meats for its great group dining experience, the fun decor, the delicious cocktails, and the usual of what we know Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s for. \n\nUpon checking in, we were seated at a table that was not for the right number of guests that we had. I had requested a booth but it was not noted.  I let it slide because it was getting late and we were hungry. After being seated, our waitress greeted us, handed us a lot of menus and shortly left and never returned...for a while - a long enough while for my fianc\u00e9 to be able to go wait in a long line for his '$30 dollar birthday credit' at the other end of the casino and come back and we're still waiting.  Naturally, a different server came and apologized for the wait and explained the menus to us while 'we wait for our waitress to return'.  \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I are huge winos.  For a meat restaurant, the list of by the glass cabernets is very limited, if I remember correctly, there was 1 amidst a huge wine booklet.  He finally had to opt for the one cabernet offered at $30 a glass.\n\nThe food - such a let down for what we were expecting.  Although the night started with gazpacho shots which were delicious, all the dishes that followed came out cold and/or overly salty. One of the first dishes we had was the Salmon Tartar.  Our first bites into it was met with silence - not the oh-that-was-so-good-I'm-speechless silence, more the is-it-just-our-own-particular-taste-buds-feeling-saltiness or I-don't-see-why-this-dish-is-so-great-even-though-my-friend-adamantly-recommended-it. We mentioned to our waitress the issue we had and she told us that maybe it was the nori crackers that came with the dish.  We were fine with the nori crackers' saltiness as those are chips and expected to be on the saltier side.  She let us know that nothing could be done with our tartar dish so the only thing she could do is offer us some bread in hopes that it would dilute the saltiness - ok thank you for that, moving on.  All dishes that followed were just as overly salty and the cocktails were not helping.  One of our main dishes was the Lindsay Ranch, OR, Washugyu/Angus Rib eye.  For the price we paid at $95/lb, it was underwhelming - it came out like it had been sitting on some other table for a while and the taste was quite bland.  At this point, we did not bother to mention to our waitress any of our concerns about the dishes anymore.  We just wanted to get our desserts, sing happy birthday and call it a night.   Dessert came with a candle that kept blowing out before it reached the table so it was a bit of an awkward scene for my fianc\u00e9. We ate it and asked for the bill.   The bill came and we noticed the bread was charged.  We all raised our eyebrows and decided not to make a scene.  If anything, we enjoyed the bread the most out of that evening! In our attempt to leave as soon as possible, we forgot to use the $30 credit.  We mentioned it to our waitress who then did not know how to reprocess everything, so we just waited again.  Our waitress ended up not coming back with the bill but a different gentleman did.

I'm just a person who loves food prepared well; if you got it, I want it! My partner and I have eaten here twice. I am giving somewhat of a backward review as I'm starting with our second visit. We came back just to eat the salmon sandwich, which has excellent texture and flavour. The salmon has a lovely smokiness without being dry, the bread (fried bannock) has a slight crispiness on the outside while fluffy on the inside (almost like a biscuit), and the mayo, red onion and lettuce are simple but perfect complements.\n\nThe first time we ate here, we shared the three sisters soup, I had the salmon plate with wild rice salad on the side, while my partner had the sandwich. Although the soup had corn and beans in it, the third sister (squash) was visibly missing, and the broth was a bit watery and lacking flavour. The salmon on my plate was the same as the sandwich, so no complaints there. The wild rice salad was a little on the sweet side for my taste. \n\nThe service is friendly and the venue is quaint, with traditional products near the cash register and decor that reflects the culture.

I chose their Ceasar salad, cornish game hen, and butter tart with maple ice cream.\n\nThe salad was very good.  The ingredients were fresh, and the dressing wasn't overpowering or overdone.  My biggest complaint about this course?  Our waiter was a little on the lurk-y side.  I know we were there for an earlier sitting, and that they would be taking reservations after ours, but coming to check on me four or five times during a single course?  It's a bit much.  My boyfriend had sweet potato fries with a lemon aioli while I ate my salad, and he said they were fresh, sweet, and the quantity was such that it began to justify the hefty price tag.\n\nThe cornish game hen was good, if not a bit unforgettable.  It was certainly cooked well, but it was nothing you couldn't get at a street-level restaurant.  The butter tart, however, was fantastic.  The maple ice cream perfectly complemented the flavours, and the candied pecans sprinkled on top were a perfect addition.\n\nAll in all, I love this restaurant.  The food and experience makes the price tag feel worthwhile.\n\nThe only thing I really hate?  The forced \"photo op\" before you take the elevator to the top.

She does not like going out to fancy/expensive places so, after reading the reviews and finding out that after some research on ancestry.com she may be at least 50% Hungarian, I called Alex to make reservations for a Sunday, 12 people. \nWhen I read the reviews, I thought that I had a good idea of what it would be like but, to be honest, I was taken aback when we arrived. To say that building was old would be the understatement of the century. My family was surprised and a little worried after seeing the outside of the building. This is not your typical chain restaurant set up. This is what I would consider authentic. If you went to visit your long lost relatives in Hungary and great grandma welcomed you to her home to serve you a big meal, this is probably what her house would look like. The fact that the restaurant shows its age and its use made it more real for me. But don't expect frills and thrills. That's the food's job.\n You have to walk through the small kitchen to get to the back room where three long tables are set up. The tables are covered in plastic table cloths and there are plastic utensils and styrofoam plates in the middle. The room is filled with pictures, knick knacks and other memorabilia. Alex also turned on some authentic music for ambience.\nWe opened the wine we brought and loosened our belts. Then the food started. Served family style. Appetizers were first. Amazing flat bread, cabbage salad and a tomato/pepper soupy concoction that blew me away. Next course: peasant soup. Think the warm, flavorful chicken soup grandma would make you from scratch when you were sick. Warms the soul. Next up: cabbage and noodles. My favorite with a few spices for a little kick on the classic. Then the entrees came. Transylvanian pork with cabbage and served with bread. Then a chicken dish with noodles. After all of the food was served, Alex came out with a plate of dessert-crepe/tortilla type bread with chocolate chips and dates. Alex then answered our questions about history and culture. All of this for 20$ a person. We added a little extra for an extra tip.

First, understand that the truck driver is an outside hire and not an employee of Bellhops. He did not bring enough blankets to protect my furniture, and the movers asked if I had any of my own to use. Having already packed up my apartment I had to scramble to find alternate solutions (rugs, towels, a blanket from my car). The furniture was fine after the move, just wished they had arrived better equipped; I would recommend to the Bellhops movers to keep an extra blanket or two in their cars just in case.\n\nSecondly, I had my carpets cleaned at my new place the day before but sadly one of the movers had mud on their shoes and tracked it in even though I had rugs and towels by the door to wipe their feet. I was able to clean it up, but wish they used those shoe covers upon entering the house.\n\nOther than that things went fine and the movers worked well together; no damage on anything and they finished well within the allotted time frame.

Basically had to push them out, so people could have room to sit and not be squished.

It does have a bar in the back, so you can always get something to drink.  They do have waitress walking around, so you don't have to get up all the time.  They do have booth, for those VIP people.

Then again, if you can handle the crowd who can't shut it, withstand the uncomfortable seating and focus on the performance, then its not a bad place over all.

While I was playing the Maximum Tuning 3 in gameworks the four arcade systems were not linked up together even though it would be enjoyable to race against my cousin and other people. The card reader of the games does not work and they, gameworks, does not fill them with cards so kids or anyone could save their progress in the game.\n\nThe only good thing was the initial D 4. Everything about the game worked for example playing against other people, cards, and machines mechanics.\n\nOther games- These games are working but may have some problems. Throughout the place I say about 80% of the games are working.\n\nBad games-  These games are either off or broken. They have a couple of these machines located in the fighting games area.\n\nI came back to see if anything change, there were just a little changes.\nThe midnight maximum tuning 3 did finally work of reading cards, vs, and ghost battle if you have a card already. The only thing about it is the machines still do not carry the cards to save data on it and play it later, because I luckily had a card that was that version and I began to play the game but sadly I ran out of certain number of plays a card can handle. I needed the machine to at least have 1 brand new card so I can update the card and play where I left off.\n\n------ Little info. on what I mean about the cards.\nThe cards are considered memory cards for the game. Each card has a sixty game life, meaning if you lose a race, win a race, time race, ghost battle, and etc. it counts down until zero, when it reaches zero the player puts the card back in and the machine will offer to get a new card. If the machine had these special cards I would of got a new card and played longer, but I left disappointed and found something better to do.\n\n\nNOTE: The three stars are for the games I described.", "user_id": "4IFxhtyREvDru1XWlC1Szg", "review_id": "2UqJWnj0D17ga3Cajy1I4w", "cool": 0, "business_id": "Z3owSx_4NJerX08DO5FOtA"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 4, "funny": 0, "date": "2015-08-22", "text": "Divan Orange !!!

But... Here's what I experienced:\n\nThe good: My bed was comfy. The pool (even though I didn't get to use it) looked awesome. I know others enjoyed it. I was offered an Arnold Palmer as soon as I stepped into the lobby, which was nice. The staff was friendly. \n\nThe not-so-good: No tub in my room. Seriously? No bathtub? I mean, the shower was big... but it's a hotel. Unless I'm staying at the YMCA Youth Hostel, I generally expect a tub in my room. The carpets in the conference center smelled musty and moldy and like old cleaning chemicals. Not pleasant, at all, especially when you're sitting in conference rooms for hours at a time. The food. Honestly, this could have been my biggest issue, so I'm going to go into more detail.\n\nThe Buttes is a popular place for weddings. Some of the views are great, so I can see how some might see it as a great place to gather. But if the food they gave us was anything like the food they offer at weddings, I'd NEVER use it. \n\nAt the conference we had colleagues from all over the country; Florida, Texas, Ohio, Arizona and Pittsburgh. I blame all the whiteys from the east coast for our food the first night. I think the chefs saw that the majority of the people with us were from out of town and wouldn't know good Mexican food if it bit them. So what we got resembled Mexican food in name only. We were served rice, beans, shredded beef, chicken fajitas, shrimp fajitas, with taco shells and tortillas to put it all into. The rice was red, but tasted like nothing. The shredded beef had zero flavour. No salt, nothing. It was literally the blandest meat I'd ever had. The chicken and shrimp fajitas were so overpowered with bell peppers that they tasted like a microwave meal. The salsas were bland and flavourless, which complimented the meal perfectly. .... Dessert was disappointing too, except for the tres leches cake. It wasn't great, but it was definitely the best thing of the whole spread. \n\nThe food the rest of the time I was there pretty much followed suit. Bland, flavourless. Runny eggs for breakfast. Dry 30-hour roast beef. Some of the desserts weren't too bad, but even then they seemed like they were packaged, not made in house. For instance, the flan looked, and tasted, like little piles of pudding on top of Smucker's caramel sauce. I don't think there was anything that I can say, \"Oh yeah! That was awesome!\" Truly disappointing. \n\nAll in all, I don't know that I would make it a 4 star resort. 3 stars maybe. I don't think I'd go back unless someone else was footing the bill.

What I cannot accept is employees who are not customer service oriented, unprofessional, unfriendly, and not willing to do what it takes to ensure an efficient and quality experience.  \n\nIf you're looking to buy something quickly on the run before you make your connecting flight, don't bother to stop here because the employees work at their own leisure and pace - even with the manager present.  \n\nI walk in and see 6-7 people in line waiting to make a purchase.  There are 3 Registers and minimum of 5-6 total employees (wow, seems overstaffed).  At first glance 2 of the Registers were processing customers while the 3rd was occupied by an employee processing paperwork.  I pick up my soda (Coke Cherry Zero - - the highlight of the experience) and stand patiently in line, now Customer # 6 in queue.  Okay, I'll be patient.  \n\nOne of the employees ringing up customers then stops her work and turns around to help another employee who is asking questions and looking for something (a \"book\").  The 2nd register employee slows down her work to engage into the discussion for assistance.  The other 2 employees then walk away to go retrieve the book leaving 1 register open with a (now) queue of 10 people waiting in line.  Meanwhile the manager (I believe - male authority figure) is standing next to the register and is watching her process orders, plus the other register is still processing paperwork.  There is also another employee standing nearby and starts talking with the other two who are looking for \"the book\".  \n\nThe Math:  Out of 6 total employees 3 of them are standing around chit-chatting while 1 authority figure is observing and the other 2 are doing work where only one of those two is actually ringing up customers.  The queue is now @ 10 and I'm # 5.  Yay!!  There is no sense of priority or urgency in processing customers in a timely and efficient manner.  A few minutes later I move up to #2, and even though I'm next in line the manager proceeds to point to the girl behind me (#3) saying they will be able to ring her up on the other side (register now open - she finished her work).  The girl behind me then looks at me and says \"you're next in line so I'll wait after you....\".  Cool beans - - thank you.  She (customer) was more cognisant than all of the 6 employees combined.  \n\nI nearly put my drink down and walked off - - why should I even give this establishment my $$ and support when they don't seem to give a rats behind about quality customer service.  If it wasn't for that damn hot sauce I just had w/ my meal I would have done it - - I swear!  But a nice cold Coke Cherry Zero sounded so damn good at the time - - it was a thirst quencher, still not worth $2.78 but that's a whole other story. \n\nLike I said - - if you're in a hurry or really dislike waiting too long in lines, or don't care for low morale or poor customer service and execution then don't bother to stop in here.  Lesson's Learned = don't do anything that would provoke you to having the need to buy something here (i.e. the need to quench your burning throat w/ a cold beverage due to excess consumption of hot sauce).  \n\nToodles!!", "user_id": "DOj9NanlJP3xntULCy5Uow", "review_id": "pYtLL4v2z5Jp6LW4PlwFqQ", "cool": 3, "business_id": "Medu0lUplLW_8yu8VcfbFg"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "date": "2017-12-01", "text": "Awesome place !

My wife and I visited around 15 centers and had nearly given up finding a center we felt fully confident in until we found Maple Bear.  After our initial visit I know this would be the right place.  Management is professional and organized, the center itself is very clean.  The providers there are engaged with the kids and parents and communicate often.  I knew the center was a good one when our child would mention on weekends if she could go to school for the day - or were not fun parents :).\n\nConsidering that child to provider ratio is better than AZ requirements, the price is more than fair.  The only other center that we found with equivalent ratios is Bright Horizons, which we did take our daughter to for awhile.  When you compare fees between the two, Maple Bear is a far better value.  You pay less without giving up the most important attribute of a daycare - consistent, safe and engaged quality care for the kids.\n\nThe physical layout of the center has a large indoor play area when necessary but it's a smaller center than other daycares which allows the center from not having too many kids.  The outdoor play area is split into two, one for the younger kids and the other for older.  I do like that the location of the Center is a bit remote off to the side as it keeps cross traffic to a minimum and keeps things quiet.  \n\n\nCons - only one, parking lot directly across the center is a bit small and it can fill up during peak times.  However, it's not like you have to sit in your car for 5 minutes for a space.

The prices are a little high but I don't expect anything less for a hotel like Wynn/Encore especially being on the strip.

Yes, sir, this place is as good as I remembered.\n\nThis restaurant is in an unlikely location. It's inside Four Queens. Downtown Las Vegas has drastically improved over the last few years but admittedly I still hold my purse close to me when I walk around. I would highly suggest to valet your car because the garage elevator was broken and I had to go down four flights of stairs in heels!

The restaurant is dark and has a old school Vegas feel. We were seated in a booth, and I appreciated the romantic ambiance. Waiters were all wearing tuxedos. They even poured water with a certain flair.\n\nMy favorite part about this place is the table side prepared salad. It comes free with your entree and you get an array of toppings to choose from! They give a cute mini raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palette. I ordered the ribeye steak and my husband got the Chilean sea bass. We both savored every single bite and still had leftovers to take home! \n\nI'm not sure if it's because they knew it was our anniversary but we got hooked up with lots of desserts! We got an assortment of chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots to dip in whipped cream. Then we got a chocolate mousse cake that was melt-in-your-mouth amazing!

But as my five stars state: Awesome!  \n\nSo I was going on a blind date and she happened to be living in the area.  It's a bit of a drive for me, but it was near her so I figured this would be a prime location.  \n\nI showed up with the usual fears one has on a blind date:  Will I show up and have that awkward trying to find you moment.  Will the locale be good? Will it be conducive to talking and finding out more about the girl.  Will it be fun?\n\nThankfully it was.  I showed up and had no difficulty locating her.  A quick walk in and you see the whole bar.  It's a U shaped bar with stools around it.  A large board displays the beers and wines they have on tap and the bar the atmosphere is conducive to talk, basically you are rubbing elbows with the friendlly crowd within. \n\nThe bar is owned by two guys, both of whom are nice as can be.  I walked in and the one of the owners was chatting with my date.  He was a bit blitzed, but he offered his seat immediately to me even though she had reserved one.  He insisted I take the seat and when I did, he plopped down next to me and talked with us.  \n\nThe bar is small enough that it's efficiently run by one of the owners and his wife.  The folks there really like their beverages, and I, being a beer afficionado, was pleasantly surprised to find a broad selection of beverages to my liking.  \n\nSo we get to the date, I'm a bit timid but the girl was beautiful and friendly, and the group was welcoming.  We talked for a bit, and marvelled over the games they had there.  They had one, which was Cards Against Humaniity, which we both loved but never got to playing because we were enjoying talking with another couple there. The plus side, people were super friendly.  The downside is that I spent more time learning about the other couple than I did the date.  Trust me, that was the only reason I would suggest any other locale for a date.\n\nIt's a bit divey, much like a good college bar, but well maintained.  A single bathroom treats both the ladies and the gents, so no complaining about lines ladies, we both suffer. However, the lines weren't an issue, as many of the folks there.  \n\nIt was a great time.  I got to try several beers that were new and unique to the area.  A huge plus.  I got to hang with some beautiful company and get to know some new folks in the area!  Eventually the bar thinned out, as many do at about 12 at night in Phoenix.  We lasted till about 1:30 and I got to have a little one on one time with her.  \n\nAs I walked her to her car, which was in broad view of the bar, I got to kiss the girl.  We started, and as we went in for the second kiss, the one that's a bit deeper, we heard the bar cheering.  She was laughing so hard that more kissing was out of the question.  Thanks guys, worst wingmen ever!  \n\nThat said, I was at Magnum's before this, so no matter how much water, beer, and chewing gum I had, I knew I still had the flavor of cigar on me. The date was impromptu, so I was thankful that I even got the kiss in the first place.\n\nAnyways, The Whining Pig is well worth the five star reputation that it's recieved.

The sauce wasn't near enough either, had to order more.\nThe chicken burrito was large but mostly meat.  Needed more rice, beans etc.  We weren't too thrilled with this.  \nThe eating area is pretty large. It is like a large cafe.

We were approached by a man named \"Jeff\" on the Caesar's Palace property asking us if we wanted to be entered in a contest to win a free corvette. Fine whatever. He THEN said, that we get free show tickets just for entering the contest, and that all we had to do after that was go on a tour of a new hotel they'd just built right off the strip and tell all your friends about it when you get done; free advertising, right?! We were also told we'd receive free lunch and that the tour would not exceed two hours, as we stressed we had a dinner reservation. Little did we know...\n\nWhat REALLY happened:\nOn Saturday (Valentines day), they loaded us onto a bus and took us about 10 miles away from everything, where the hotel was. We then had to sit in the lobby and wait for our sales rep to scoop us up and then sit in on the hell presentation. I have to admit, Monique was VERY good at giving her speech. After an hour, our sales rep showed us around the place, talked to us about vacationing...etc etc. I was hungover as hell and too tired to listen to someone talk about something I didn't care about. He finally sat us down to talk about pricing...$529/month for 84 months with a 17% APR PLUS a $699/year \"maintenance fees\"...HAHAHA ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! That's beyond laughable. Plus, when you DO stay there, you pay for wifi, additional cleaning, resort fee...what a waste of money!! After telling these people no for about 30 minutes AND being told \"well, you guys don't really look like you're eligible for owning a timeshare anyways!\" (You're damn right!), we were taken into a room and sat down with a \"corporate member\" and offered us around 5k for the timeshare. I swear these people were ridiculous. THEN, we had to wait another 40 minutes to sit down with someone to get our free gifts. (Btw, when we DID get our show tickets, the only seats left were single seats in the crowd!) finally, we got back on bus and got back to our hotel around 6:00pm.\n\nAfter my experience there, I would like to say this to grand view hotels: thank you SO much for wasting my fianc\u00e9 and I's ENTIRE afternoon on Valentine's Day and causing us to miss our dinner reservations!

Went for the first time a week ago. We were a party of 4 and sat in the bar area because it was very busy as it was a Friday night. The food took quite some time to come out once we ordered but our server made up for it as she kept the drinks coming and provided excellent service overall. The owner David came by our table and checked in on us. He was very nice. He shared the story behind opening the restaurant. \n\nSo for the food...I ordered the fried chicken dinner. The chicken and the potatoes were delicious! The cole slaw was terrible. And I love cole slaw so I was a bit disappointed. There was too much dressing (Miracle Whip and not mayonnaise maybe??). My daughter ordered the burger. It was very dry and meat was almost crumbly. Hubby had the Chile Verde nachos. Loaded with meat and very tasty. Huge portion! He loved it. He also liked the huge variety of beers on tap. \n\nAmbiance was nice. Large bar area and 2 different patios if you want to sit outdoors. \n\nFast forward about a week later. We visited for the 2nd time at 4:30 pm or so on Saturday. It wasn't nearly as busy as our first visit. Plenty of open tables when we were seated. Hubby ordered the fish tacos and enjoyed it. He also had a California roll. Said you could tell it was fresh. I had the fried chicken again although I really wanted to try the pot pie. In hindsight, maybe I should have. My son in law also ordered the fried chicken dinner and my daughter ordered the fried chicken sandwich. We brought our friend who was in from Germany as well and he had some sort of beef sandwich. The fried chicken dinner was disappointing this go around. A bit dry and over cooked. My son in law ended up getting a chicken sandwich in spite of ordering the dinner. The runner had it fixed within a few minutes. Appreciated. However! The service was atrocious! Or should I say lack of service. Again, food coming out was extremely slow. Sara was our server. She rarely checked on us. Never apologized for the slow service. Never filled our drinks until we flagged her down. At one point, we bussed our own table because we were tired of having our dirty dishes on our table so I got up and put them on the table next to us. We never got her attention and most of the time couldn't find her when we needed anything. I'd highly recommend requesting at the time of seating to NOT sit in her section. This visit ran us about $135. \n\nAnyway, the place seems to have pretty decent food for the most part. Expect very slow service in regards to getting your food once you order.

The Risotto Balls were both our faves for the night. Crunchy outside with creamy filling, and sweet and acidic tomato sauce made this the most balanced dish. The giant Meatball lives up. It tastes good, but we agreed it was too big for one person to eat alone. I also like my burgers well done, so find the medium cook a bit of a put off, but very juicy and probably the best value.\nThe squash crispelle was really delicious. I loved the sage butter sauce, but again, it was just sweet, salt and cream, missing some fresh herbs and acid so it was great as a dish to share, but again, not balanced enough for a full meal. Finally, we had the crispy chicken. It was crispy and moist inside, but the tapenade added salt on salt. I used my sage-butter sauce on the chicken and THAT was stellar, crispy, creamy, sweet, salty - that was a perfect bite that should be on the menu. \n$40 for food (with no leftovers) plus tax and tip is a bit pricey for food-only, but our noses and mouths agreed, the Nose is a good place to go.", "user_id": "J9incfcELJH0S_DPgOLuFA", "review_id": "n_UbrQ6kNmW34SKEXXItwA", "cool": 0, "business_id": "3qTSOuJ-ZyU1L7o62KHSIg"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "date": "2014-01-27", "text": "The 5-stars are for the lovely manicurist, Rose!

Don't. There are better Italian places.\n\nSo this place basically seems to be a house converted into a tiny Italian restaurant. That's a cool concept but when you step inside, they don't capitalize on it. To me, I didn't know what the theme of this place is. It's in a tiny house, but it's Chicago Joe's restaurant. But what's so damn Chicago about it? I didn't get that from any of the decor or the atmosphere or anything. It was just there. There's a street sign that says \"ROOSEVELT DRIVE.\" Maybe that's the Chicago part. Also, the bathroom is right next to the kitchen, which is just strange. Everything just seems off. If it was marketed like grandma's house or something, I could understand that. But maybe all bathrooms are L shaped in Chicago. \n\nWe had a table of about ten for a Birthday dinner and my girlfriend and I arrived a few minutes late. Still it took 15 minutes after we arrived before we had a server take our order. Again, this place isn't huge. Our server even at the end of dinner told us that we were his only table, so not sure why it took so long. The server didn't seem to know the difference between the different types of spaghetti and had trouble remembering who ordered what. Not sure why he was flustered, not like any of us were asking some hard hitting questions. \n\nThe food took even longer to come out. A few of my friends were concerned as they had a show to get to. We finally had to ask the server to expedite their orders and to bring a to go box with the meal when it came out. We had arrived an hour and a half before these friends needed to be somewhere, so you would think we would have time to eat dinner.\n\nDinner comes out and the server just is confused about everything. He's giving the wrong plate to the wrong people, one dish had to be remade as it was not gluten free pasta which was requested. People were getting soup when they wanted salad. There was extra spaghetti on the table. Things were just falling off the wheels. But this is Chicago Joe's! The food has to be good!\n\nNo.\n\nI ordered meat lasagna. The restaurant isn't well lit so it was hard to see but there was just a mound of meat on top of the lasagna. At least they didn't skimp on the meat. But the lasagna was unevenly heated, as there were molten pockets of lasagna next to lukewarm patches. Figuring it was microwaved and I could only hope that it was made sometime that week. We could only hope. I ate a bit of it before it just started to hurt my stomach. Not great. Not great.\n\nGirlfriend got spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were a joke. This is an Italian restaurant, the meatballs NEED to be good and they were bland as all hell. So we're paying 15 bucks for some boiled grain and bland meat. By the way, prepare to pay Chicago prices. That's what makes it so Chicago.\n\nSo everything about the night was underwhelming and the next half an hour consisted of our waiter trying to figure out how to split the bill. We were willing to do it whichever way was easiest, but he assured us that he could split the bills (and this is when he told us we were his only table). He was gone for an extended amount of time, and then when he came back he just looked at our table, made a face, and walked away without saying anything. I don't know what that was about. I was worried about him. \n\nWe finally got the bill split figured out but it just took so long. Nothing made sense as to why everything took so long. My lasagna was reheated, why did it take so long? Why did splitting the check take THAT long? Why did taking the orders take so long? Why is the bathroom an L shape? That's not something Chicago Joe could solve but it's just worth asking in general.\n\nOverall, this was not a great experience. There are much better Italian places to go to and if you wanted mediocre food, you could just go to the OG. At least it's cheaper, and there are breadsticks. \n\nSkip this place.", "user_id": "y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA", "review_id": "K6B0GcC5hReRyWVAuLFraQ", "cool": 2, "business_id": "MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg"}, {"useful": 2, "stars": 5, "funny": 2, "date": "2016-01-02", "text": "This place is so good!!!

Not so much with sparkling wine though. It took us a good hour to go through all of the tastings, and by the last few they were roo temperature. This our fault really.

The wine by the glass hovered around 20 dollars I think. A tad steep if you ask me, but then again I really doesn't have a pint of reference for wine in this city anymore.

After walking in with a stack full of ones, we were surprised to find out the full name of the place was Strip House...Steak House.  Wakka wakka.\n\nUndeterred we decided to have prix fixe dinner in one of the private rooms.  Our event planner Gabe was awesome and we were able to have some tastefully Photoshop'd artwork affixed to the menus.  As for atmosphere, all I can think of is red.  TLC Red Light Special red, which I suppose goes well with medium rare steaks and red wine flowing.  It's more club chic than steakhouse really.  The private room itself was nice as it pretty much shut out all outside noise once the door was closed.  This proved vital as a fellow female patron was apparently 1 or 5 cocktails in, but who's counting.\n\nIf you're hungry you're going to love the prix fixe menu.  The 14oz Dry Aged Rib Eye is not bone-in.  So yes, that is 14oz of pure unadulterated bovine ready to make sweet love to your cheeks.  One of the salad selections was the Roasted Bacon salad.  The term \"salad\" being used very loosely.  Okay, it was essentially three big slabs of bacon with a small mound of greens because the chef thought \"why not, yolo.\"  Simply brilliant.   I haven't even gotten to the desserts, which include a chocolate cake bigger than some household pets.  If you do a prix fixe menu here, there's is no way you will leave without a food baby gestating in your stomach.  So if you're planning to go to the club after, leave a couple hours buffer to drink some coffee and flush your system.  Otherwise that $1000 bottle minimum will be no bueno.  Trust.\n\nThe service itself is top notch.  Our waiter shared some war stories and everything came out fairly fast and on-point.

It was a great experience that I would go back again with someone who wanted to see the CN tower, but not for the food. \n\nFirst off, I went on a Sunday, at 1:45 PM, so the CN tower and this restaurant wasn't quite as crowded as it could be. We requested window seats in the reservation and they gave them to us without a fuss. We had to sit in the waiting area for maybe 5 minutes while they got our table ready-- but that wasn't a bad thing since they had little hard candies that were pretty yummy. \n\nAt the table, we spent a long time just watching planes take off from Toronto Island, and trying to identify the surrounding city. We ordered (the waiters are very efficient and some were very unhappy if you try to ask them to take a picture of you) and then got some bread to eat. The bread came out cold, but was still pretty good. \n\nFor appetizer, I got the chowder and my partner got the mushroom bruschetta. The chowder was nothing special, but the bruschetta was a actually pretty delicious. \n\nFor entree, I got the chicken and my partner got the strozzapreti. My chicken was a bit bland and dry, with uninspiring grilled vegetables underneath. I didn't taste any truffle or enough salt in the dish. I ended up not eating most of the chicken and saving it for stuffing into a sandwich with some tomato and sauce. \n\nThe strozzapreti was also pretty simple, but a bit more flavorful once you mixed in the eggplant mixture and cheese. There was a lot of tomato and wild mushrooms in the dish, and if you ate each bite of pasta with some tomato, it was actually pretty delicious. \n\nThe dessert was probably the highlight of the meal. I got a dark chocolate tower and my partner got a warm cranberry pecan tart. The chocolate tower was a tower of chocolate mousse drizzled with hard chocolate and sprinkled with orange peels, served next to some mandarin slices. The mousse wasn't quite as melt-in-your-mouth delicious as I'd expected, but it went pretty well with the orange peel. The cranberry tart was actually delicious, with a crust that tasted like shortbread, sour bite from the cranberry, and pecan-y crunch from the candied pecans. \n\nAfter lunch, we walked down to the observation deck and glass floor, wandered around, and then proceeded downstairs. The only downside is that this meal does not get you entrance into the 4D movie after you arrive on the ground floor, but that's a small gripe. Overall, $55 for a decent meal and trip to the CN tower glass floor was worth it.", "user_id": "HF8k3B7g7xk3wJZj3wK1Vg", "review_id": "UxDwUpoQUlU3MjlTmfCuVQ", "cool": 0, "business_id": "mG71gQ5HWl7ut9OCN6NJKA"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 3, "funny": 0, "date": "2017-08-07", "text": "Lunch time during a long weekend was pretty quiet.

I generally go in for a large, hot, Cafe Americano with room for cream ($3.75 - told you, not cheap) and today I had something new, a toasted English muffin with jam (the person taking the order referred to as a jammy dodger, maybe a UK expression) and it takes a few minutes to toast but it comes out blazing hot with a little bag with a napkin, plastic knife and a little container of butter and one of jam, at least this time it was apricot and it was delicious, I have a feeling it is locally made (assumption on my part). The texture of the English Muffin was wonderful, weighty texture and crusty and I'm assuming it is also locally made.

One of the most over the top breakfasts can be had at Hash House a Go Go.  They are known for their crazy concoctions of burgers stacked high, pancakes larger than pizzas, and breakfast plates big enough for three, four maybe. I have been to the one in San Diego, and the long wait was rewarded with plates of impossible to finish food.  Delicious at that.  Going to Vegas, knowing there was a Hash House off the strip and on the strip, my breakfast was set.\n\nWe ordered the iced pistachio mocha to start things off.  It was milky and ice cold.  The pistachio taste was subtle, but there.  It was similar to the Nutella shake at Burger Bar. The chocolate was a nice background flavor.  Imagine chocolate hazelnut (nutella) but then replace the hazelnut with pistachio. It worked!  Tasty!\n\nThe craziest dish I have ever seen was the sausage gravy pot pie.  It had scrambled egg and mashed potatoes which was normal.  This was I guess their version of sausage and biscuits, but mutated to a giant monster.  The bottom was a bowl formed by an upside down hat made of a biscuit type bread.  Inside the bowl was massive amounts of mashed potatoes which kind of sucked. There was even a bunch underneath the makeshift bowl.    I was looking for more sausage pieces, though there were some.  After a few bites of this dish, it was a bit tiring.  I don't see how anyone can finish this dish.  Carb overload is an understatement.\n\nMy chorizo hash was sensible, but still came in a skillet.  It had jalapeno, red onion, cheddar cheese, and fresh tomatoes.  The kick from the jalapeno was a wake up call, especially compared to the monotone of the pot pie.  Chorizo is spicy as well, so this dish had a lot of flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked over easy.  Though there was nothing special about this one, it at least kept me interested.\n\nHash House a Go Go is a place to go eat.  They make sure you are full, and you leave with a doggy bag every time. This is the opposite of tapas small plates.  You get one big plate, and a lot of it.  The food isn't boring for sure.  They try to keep it interesting with interesting combinations and portions that are too big to make sense. I guess that is the fun of it all.

I'm not talking one or two either, I can easily find a handful on any given visit to the store. An empty latte here, a soda can there, they are seemingly on every other isle. Not only do the trashy customers leave this stuff there, but the staff in the store never cleans it up, which only exacerbates the problem. \n\nLast but not least, I have to address the clientele themselves. The folks in here seem to be a hodgepodge of bored millennials, trashy hipsters and of course the ever present helicopter parents with their unattended, screaming, misbehaving spawn. Again, I was surprised at first that it as so much worse than less classy areas of town, but I finally realized it had more to do with the Marshall's component than it did with the HomeGoods franchise. Anytime you have discount clothing in the mix, it brings out the real garbage among the \"value shopper\" demographic, like flies to a freshly laid turd. These people are not shopping there because they're savvy, but because they're cheap. It's basically the same customer culture you see in Walmart, and for the same reason. \n\nOn the positive side, I have snagged a few deals here, including some nice Stelton branded candle holders (about 80% below retail) and some nice NanDog branded pet beds (more than half off retail price). There are always gems to be found, at least on the HomeGoods side of the store, but it is regrettable how much the Marshall's side of the house brings this location down. Would I recommend it?

However it seemed to blow my wallet away. The line was extremely long - even being tipsy didn't help. Cheery though I was, this line didn't seem to want to budge. I even saw an old-lady try to bribe her way in with $100 but there is no mercy for the buffet -bystanders. She was promptly sent to the back of the line. Ouchhhh.

Drove from Northern Phoenix and found the food well worth the drive. \n\nCame in with a couple of gals to have Pho for lunch and came in with big appetites. We decided to start with Egg Rolls (Cha Gio) and Veggie Spring Rolls because we were super hungry and we had a Vegan with us. For the main entree, I opted for my personal favorite: Pho Tai, simple bowl of Pho with thin raw slices of beef and typically topped with onions and/or green onions.\n\nThe Egg Rolls came out fresh and piping hot, filled with Wood Ear mushroom, meat and a bit of veg and served with dipping sauce. These also come out with a few cucumbers, perilla and lettuce to eat with the Egg Rolls. Two thumbs up for scalding hot egg rolls, delicious in flavor and pretty big in size.\n\nPho Tai came out in a small sized bowl, but filled with noodles, a beautiful brown broth, slices of thin beef and sliced green onions. Don't be fooled by the small bowl, it holds a good amount of noodles and broth nearly at the brim. The broth was absolutely delicious and as close in flavor to the Pho I was raised on and can be found in the Bay Area. Good balance or savory, sweet and aromatic. The pieces of beef were actually really tender and soft to eat, I've found that some places provide really tough slices of beef which ruins the eating experience. Another good sign here is the freshness and abundance of greens served along side your Pho. Here they serve a good amount of bean sprouts, lime, jalapeno, mint and Thai basil. So go right ahead and pile what you want in your Pho and I don't care who says it, go ahead and add Hoisin and Sriracha to your soup. You're the one eating it!\n\nService here is expected from most Vietnamese establishments, pretty casual and informal. It's not uncommon to see owners, staff members or family having their lunch at tables in plain sight or on their phone. Though it's the type of environment that's not found in corporate or chain restaurants, these mom and pop shops serve up what's real. The man serving us was great, he took our orders, refilled waters and was always an earshot away if we needed anything. Definitely, would come back.

I took immediate notice to the dress code of the servers.  EVERY SINGLE waitress had to tug down their one piece \"dress\" for every 10 steps they took.  Unnecessarily tight for servers in a restaurant... but it wasn't just the women... the men had on Polo's that also appeared to be suffocating them.  The only people who looked to be comfortable in their uniforms were the floor managers.   We did get our beers fairly quickly, once greeted by our waitress.

We all ordered our burgers medium.  \n\nI'm still laughing at the irony of being in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and waiting 45 minutes for our burgers to come out.  Mind you, there was no wait, it was 11pm and the restaurant was at less than half capacity.  Even more ironic, all of our burgers came out well done.\n\nNow, we all cut our burgers into 3's and split amongst ourselves to sample it all.

The hairdressers usually just repeat for me what he got last time and do their thing. Done. \n\nThis time was weird. I think I got a hairdresser in training because from the beginning she thought it was a good idea to put my sons body cover thing on as a cape. (I'm not even going to get into how long it took me to take all the hair out of his clothes and my car today.) She seemed new even just the way she cut his hair. I think anyone with children can agree the faster the cut the better. She was being very careful like she was reciting steps or something and he was getting impatient. Then I pointed something out to her and this seemed to stress her out as finally she called over to her supervisor for help. I told her I don't know the terminology for what I'm trying to say or else I would explain it better. It felt like I was talking Chinese to her and she was getting more nervous by the minute. The supervisor was cutting someone else's hair so she was taking forever to come over to take a look (which quite honestly made the situation worse because it takes less than a minute to give her instructions on how to blend something out) , but alas. \n\nFinally I told the hairdresser to blend this one little section that was sticking out like a sore thumb and line him up and that should be fine. She took the pair of scissors and starting cutting hair off the top of his head (after I had just told her we usually keep it long on top). I felt like I was going crazy because, like I said, I bring my son here every other week for a hair cut and have tried everyone that works here. What is going on today?\n\nFinally I told her just to leave it. At that point I just wanted to leave. To top it off, I over heard the supervisor telling the hairdresser 'Good Job' for completing the haircut without her help..as we walked to cashier. How about asking ME how everything went? Horrible experience. Don't know if I'll risk coming here again. BECAUSE I'm so laid back about my kids haircut one of my pet peeves is when people mess with his hair. \n\n**Tip for this location: keep a closer eye on your newbies ... nothing at all against people just learning, but keeping up on their progress, especially in the beginning, is critical to successful integration.

The food was edible enough (it's kinda hard to screw up steamed hot dogs), but the blatantly ridiculous part of the operation is a complete lack of employee training. During both visits, it seemed like the guys behind the counter were ripped directly from the customer line-up, with zero knowledge of the menu, or how to serve and prepare the steamies being offered. They seem to have greatly reduced the steamed hotdog options since opening, which is not surprising, since the guys dolling out the tube meat on my first visit had no clue what I ordered was even on their menu, leading to confused faces between the two gents before they checked every nook and cranny of their stations before finally putting two and two together. My second order was also a bit weird, with the guy at the cash being perplexed that I'd pay for a $3.75 order with a $10 bill, as if he had never made change before (\"you know it's only $3.75, right?\"). This was followed by his obviously freshly hired underling asking him how to properly fold the foil wrappers of the hotdogs when preparing my order, something one would assume would be covered in the first three minutes of training. He got neither of the two wrappers right btw, despite instructions being printed on them. Considering how perpetually empty the location is, I'm surprised it's lasted this long. Perhaps the other Smoke's locations are keeping it afloat? The visible increase of poutine on their menu (it now takes up 3/4 of the menu screens, as opposed to less than half at opening) indicates that they're smartly moving away from the clearly failing \"Weinerie\" concept.

You mean you don't want to \"work\" for the money I pay you. WTF? I've never been so insulted. And I'm not even a difficult client. In the year I've been going here, Kim has barely said two words to me (which is Ok. I just want my nails done). I continued to go back week after week because she was good. Six months ago I walked in without an appt and let someone else do my nails. Mistake. She cut me and the buff was awful. Kim actually stepped over to finish the job. And I tip well for good service. \n\nSo understand how floored I was when I was told today Kim doesn't want to work on me any more. I was told her arm hurts too much after buffing my nails and she feels awkward. You're kidding, right? Now, if I was a jerk customer; demanding, loud, lousy tipper, etc I can see it. But I'm none of that. In fact, when I find what I like, I'm loyal. And I've been loyal here. And I pay without complaint. And I tip well, always. That's why I'm so pissed to have been turned away because the job is too difficult. That's just lazy! Yes, L-A-Z-Y!!! You perform a service. I pay you money. I have the right to be particular. You have the responsibility to do your job well. Today, they lost a customer and a fan. What happened today was BS. \n\nI will NEVER recommend this business.

I had the best fast food at all time!\n\nThey have this NEW DELICIOUS fish burger/sandwich that is on test menu/promo for $4.99! Omg it was the MOST delicious fish burger ever! I wasn't sure about it n asked the staff if she had tried. Her response was like \"omg it's so yum\" with(the word it's amazing written on her face)so that decided for me. They made fresh fish sandwich for me n omg the fish was NOT as small as I expected like u get from McDonals! The corners of square fish was sticking out of the actual bun, that's how big they were. it's literally huge piece of thick fish that is lightly breaded fried golden outside , juicy and soft and flaky inside. It's white fish not fishy all. Something u will have to pay $17 for a quality fish sandwich at restaurant . Simple tarta sauce, lattes tomato and onion. It was soooo soo soo yum. The combo came with option of half onion ring n half fries(awesome ) ! Onion ring were fluffy n so delicious! I ordered the apple pie! 2 for $2. Omg it was soo delicious! The pasty was flaky n fresh the inside Apple was not sour like McDonalds. \n\nI am writing this n feeling mouth watering! I ate everything . Surprisingly I normally have small appetite n I feel full very fast, but it was much better than any fast food I have had last while! I did however need to have 2tb spoon of Pepto Bismo as soon as i got home due to binging.  I don't usually eat fast or oily food so I have difficulty digesting it but I got so excited anyway .  My bf was trying tempt me to eat n offered to buy more food like poutine n more pies . I was Able to stop tho so I prevented myself from going over the board! They have $5.99 chicken poutine! $5.79 chilly poutine! .... So many yummy treats! And it's not expansive !

There is both indoor and outdoor seating available.  \n\nThe customer service is always pretty good both inside and at the drive-thru.

Pretty nifty In-N-Out!\n\nTheir menu is simple yet so satisfying.  They only offer a few types of burgers but they do the job pretty well.  You can also ask for \"animal style\" burgers or fries, it's their own concoction of a sauce-very similar to Thousand Isle dressing.  I've had it but the burgers and fries taste delicious all on their own and you don't really need the dressing. \n\nI love, love, LOVE their french fries because they're freshly cut potatoes.  You can actually see the employees behind the counter using their handy-dandy potato slicer.  This makes that much of a difference because the fries taste so much better if they haven't been frozen.  \n\nI think it's awesome that this location draws so many tourists.  Every time I'm here, I feel like I'm at the airport.  One, because it's so busy and two because I always see so many tourists and hear all types of accents.

What you will find, though, are some outstanding independent and foreign films that aren't shown anywhere but art house cinemas and small independent cinemas that realize that the box office proceeds doesn't necessarily determine the quality of a movie.

Momofuku definitely stands out and has a unique twist to all their food. This is not a sushi/sashimi place. And I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who likes to stick to safe choices- burgers, sandwiches, sushi etc.  I heard it was mainly known for its ramen, however they did not have the pork belly ramen on the dinner menu so we were all confused. But when we asked they said they do offer the pork belly ramen...So..a little confused as to why a popular dish wasn't on the menu? And they didn't have alot of choices of ramen either. Most of us ordered the pork belly ramen and ordered lots of appetizers:\n\n-Pork belly ramen: The broth was a little salty, the pork belly was very soft and easy to chew. The noodles were okay, there was nothing \"wow\" about it. The buns tasted bland.\n-Pork belly buns- Again the pork belly was tender and good, but eating it with the bun was just a fail. The pork belly was too big to eat with the bun, it would've been easier if the meat was cut in smaller pieces maybe?\n- Shrimp buns: Shrimp buns were a little easier to eat but again it kept falling out as we tried taking a bite. The shrimp was good though with a nice sweet sauce.\n-Spicy rice cakes: The rice cakes are actually fried and diced into squares. It doesn't taste like korean spicy rice cakes but it a sweet slight soy sauce type of flavor that was pretty good.\n-Hamachi: THIS was probably my favorite small plate. It was soft and the cucumbers really complimented the fresh taste. I wish they gave abigger serving of the hamachi. It's $24 for a tiny plate!\n-Shishito Peppers: When I got a waft of the peppers it gave off that feeling where you can feel the spiciness with your eyes. But when I took a bite, I didn't taste anything! It felt like I was eating steamed peppers, and I couldn't taste the lime or saltiness. My boss disagreed, but must be just my tastebudz.\n-Crispy Potatoes: My second favorite item on the menu. So good. These were basically roasted potatoes but grated cheese and green onions. Nicely seasoned and crispy on the outside, soft and hot on the inside. I wished I was eating this with breakfast, not ramen...\n\nThere's a couple more plates we ordered but I didn't try them.\n\nOverrall the food was interesting. My gripe about this place is that the food is unique but these small plates would be great compliments to other foods that they don't offer or are too expensive. The crispy potatoes would be great with the rotisserie prime rib, if only that wasn't $72...\n\nService was prompt and efficient. The waiter was attentive and came around to always refill our waters which I really appreciated. Most convenient part was the lazy susan.

I was skeptical by the sound of it, but it was delicious. \n\nThe dining experience was made a whole lot better by the excellent wait staff, which was on point and made sure we didn't wait too long between items, and that the table was never too crowded. \n\nWe spent more than 2 hours in the restaurant catching up and having a great time.", "user_id": "e1oVWTbDYvjsqirgWrNCAA", "review_id": "PebyMFTobh4ZSy05_4Qc2w", "cool": 1, "business_id": "e178giuAicIhb16ymOtiBg"}, {"useful": 3, "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "date": "2015-05-20", "text": "I was absolutely thrilled about the cleaning we received today.

So glad I have it!!!\n\nYou never know what cars you'll see in there from Lambos, Porsches Ferarri's to Camrys & Accords. It looks like they handle the tinting for a lot of the local dealerships.\n\nDon't risk going to some sub-par outfit.
