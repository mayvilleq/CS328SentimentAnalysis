Without giving you an exact number of how many years it's been, I will tell you that Gap wanted everyone in khakis, pagers weren't quite obsolete, and Mambo #5 was tearing up the charts.  So thankfully a lot has changed, but two things remain, and will always remain the same, about student life.  Number one:  students are broke.  Number two:  they are hungry.  Say Cheese is going to make many U of T students very happy. \n\nI haven't met a grilled cheese sandwich I didn't like, and I haven't met anyone that doesn't like a grilled cheese sandwich.  That might be why so many gourmet grilled cheese places are popping up these days, but it's a risky business.  The people have spoken and they want grilled cheese sammies...but they don't want to pay a lot for them.  After all, you can make a perfectly good one at home with white bread, and cheese that's more plastic than it is dairy.  And that's where Say Cheese comes in.  Nigel Koo, part owner and operator wants to satisfy stomachs without putting a dent in wallets.  He doesn't see why he can't serve up a high quality sandwich at a low(ish) cost and have customers walking out in a lactose induced ecstasy.\n\nIt was quiet when I arrived but word wasn't really out yet, and the boys were still experimenting in their test kitchen.  I was happy to be a guinea pig.  I asked to try their most popular meat and veggie options, and this is what followed.  \n\nI started with Indira's Pulled Pork made with Beemster.  Diners can choose to have regular cheese, such as cheddar, on their sandwich ($6.50) or upgrade to a premium choice ($8.50). My creation came topped with homemade mac & cheese (fun!) on whole wheat bread.  I only ate half as I had more coming my way, but the sandwiches here are generous, and I had to pace myself.  The different textures paired nicely, but I would have liked it more had the meat been a touch saucier, or came with something in which to dip it.\n\nNext, came the Italian Classic.  Not that I'm taking bets, but if you put Buffalo mozzarella on anything, I will eat it.  So I was pleased when they said one of their best meatless sellers was filled with the stuff.  I like a good Margharita pizza, and this was the sandwich version.  \n\nAs if that wasn't enough (and by all dietary standards, it was more than that) I was offered their dessert sandwich.  It didn't take a lot of prodding, and went something like this;\n\n Nigel:  You should try our dessert option. \n\n Me:  Wow, I don't know.  I'm really stuffed.  Okay.\n\nThe French Grilled Toast is like a m\u00e9nage a trois between a grilled cheese, some French toast, and a piece of cheesecake. It's good.  Scary good.  Filled with ricotta, mascarpone and a berry compote, the sandwich is then dusted with turbinado sugar, and drizzled with maple syrup.  As with French toast, this needed to be eaten with a knife and fork, which probably worked in my best interest as it stopped me from inhaling it.  I will be going back for this one.  As it is now, I think about it more than anyone should think about a sandwich.\n\nSo in total I ended up eating just a little bit more than a full sandwich thanks to the few bites I had of the French toast, and I was beyond full.  So much so, that I actually skipped dinner that night. Now by my calculations, that equals two meals for the price of one, and a low price at that. This bodes well for hungry students up to their necks in debt.  \n\nFootnote:  During the week, for a mere thirty minutes between 4:20 and 4:50 you can get yourself a sandwich and side (including soup, salad and possible ramen...) for just $4.20.", "cool": 3, "date": "2012-02-08", "funny": 1, "review_id": "vNSWdL5NLefDGdSCMrmTTw", "business_id": "IebS6p5BNr8Qc3k7e9AmRQ", "stars": 3, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "useful": 11}, {"text": "This sushi restaurant at the corner of Queen and Caroline is a take-out superstar. You can walk in to place your order or call ahead for pick up or delivery; they add a reasonable $3.00 delivery charge for the area nearby and $5.00 + for further surrounding areas, depending on the distance. If you call with special requests or large party orders, the chefs will accommodate you in a very timely manner - if it's not on the menu, just ask!\n\nJust like the fish, the interior is raw. There is actually one very small table with some chairs around it by the front window, but I've never seen anyone sitting there. There's a display that sits just to the left when you walk in, covered with bags of Japanese snacks for purchase and, on your right, you'll find shelves filled with a few groceries; dried sheets of nori is one recognizable item that jumps out immediately.\n\nChef John Lee has been serving up fresh and beautiful sushi platters at this location since 2005. It is impressive to note that he worked under the iron chef himself, Morimoto. There is something soothing about the fact that they prepare your food behind the counter in full view. It's that commitment to preparing and presenting the freshest ingredients that has built their dedicated customer base.\n\nLunch combos range from $15 to $25 and dinner combos from $15 to $35. If you choose the sashimi - individual pieces of raw fish with no rice - it does bring the price up a bit, but it's well worth it for something so delectable. If ordering a la carte is more your style, there are unique rolls to choose from, including: nigiri sushi (fish on rice), small rolls, inside out rolls and special rolls with everything from eel to sea urchin to marinated dried pumpkin.\n\nOur dinner for two was easily fulfilled with the vegetable sushi combo, which includes miso soup, and adding one Una Tekkyu roll (eel, tuna, cucumber, fish roe) and, my sushi must, an order of edamame. The vegetable rolls are prepped delicately to appear as if they too are made with tender slices of fish, the cucumber rolls are a refreshing addition and there is even a roll with an orange, crunchy vegetable called Burdock - carrot-like in appearance and texture, but with a different and unique flavour.\n\nTheir fresh ingredients are really the highlight. Nori can easily become chewy and tough, but Marche's is tender and graces the palate without even a hint of the unappealing sea-scent that you might get from a lesser sushi establishment. I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of the cold edamame they serve, but I wouldn't want to trek my raw fish home with something steaming hot resting on top of it anyway, so I don't mind this one pre-prepared item.\n\nIf your only sushi experience is picking up a pack of that generic grocery store stuff, with the fake green grass insert, Sushi Marche is really the place to discover all the glory of raw fish.", "cool": 1, "date": "2011-02-26", "funny": 2, "review_id": "tcrc-4tMo9Zz5zLfqKhJdw", "business_id": "VeVjZ8aR_zFEM9jKJuvraw", "stars": 4, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "useful": 4}, {"text": "I have been here 3 1/2 years.

I urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as I got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn't clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt \"oops\" then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut. Next I told her I wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as I'm watching her file my nails I have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval. After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say \"that's not almond\" uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says \"hurry up\" now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies \"oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though\" can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right.

Let me start off by saying that the store has a very strong, strange odor that has lingered since they first opened (my husband says its tolerable, I find it hard to bear). The layout is nice and the store looks impressive compared to most regular grocery stores (Smiths, Vons, etc). They have a large produce selection at very affordable prices. Lots of exotic fruit, vegetables, and peppers that cannot be found at conventional grocers. However, their herbs and most greens are less than fresh and their selection of organic produce is lacking (and way too expensive when compared to Trader Joes, Whole Foods, or even Vons). They have a great selection of ready made food, but few healthy options. Pizza, ice cream, sushi, pasta salads, pasta entrees, vegetable and starch sides, etc. Some of what I've tried has been good, including salmon stuffed with spinach and pesto, green beans almondine, mixed vegetable rice, broccoli with peppers, etc. They also have a nice looking coffee and tea bar and a good selection of gourmet bread (La Brea Bakery olive bread, jalapeno cheddar, pain rustic, organic whole grain, etc). They have a huge bakery with donuts, pastries, pies and cakes at shockingly low prices, but nothing even remotely health conscious. Salad bar is run of the mill and cant hold a candle to Whole Foods, but again the prices here are incredibly reasonable. They do have an organic/natural food section but they do not have organic eggs, meat, etc. \nI could not do my regular grocery shopping here, but this place is great for specialty items and anyone shopping on a budget. It is far better than a Walmart or Smart and Final and I like the fact that it's family owned. Their produce selection is worth a trip alone. I also find myself coming here when I get home late and don't want to cook- their ready made and pre-packaged food is available 'till they close at midnight.

I lived here for 6 years. We ALWAYS paid rent on time, were respectful neighbors to the community and responsible tenants. These apartments were great..... 5 years ago. What happened? If you are debating renting here, let me fill you in on what you are really in for. \n\n2 years ago the apartments sold to new owners. That was the downfall. Instead of taking care of upgrading appliances, upgrading the landscape for renters or properly managing maintenance requests; they chose to upgrade the front office and future tenant center to increase curb appeal. They chose to close down the main pool.... right before summer. The pool was closed for months. They offered no reimbursement whatsoever. When you sign a lease you are entitled to the amenities that were provided to you when you were shown the apartments. The mailbox lock hardly ever worked and was left open a lot. Car patrolled security (non-armed) that once existed, must have gotten cut because they were no where to be seen in past years by my eye. Apartment building security lights were left burned out even after MANY maintenance requests, which was CLEARLY a security issue. This last December, there was an armed robbery.... AT THE MAILBOX at 10pm! Two men jumped from the nearby bushed area with a gun and robbed a tenant. We no longer felt safe and it was (in my opinion) because of poor management with caring about the safety and well-being of it's tenants that were already moved in.\n\nOnce you're in, why do they have to care about your satisfaction and safety? You signed a lease and they know they have you locked in. In the last 2 years, our apartment has been flooded by the upstairs unit 3 times! The first was a faulty bathtub connection but the second time was due to a maintenance repair error (as stated by the maintenance man) and was repaired VERY poorly and took over a week to complete while we couldn't use our main bathroom. The third time (see video and pictures) was also a faulty connection to a washing machine after it had recently been replaced. The managment never apologized once for the inconvenience to flooding our apartment for the third time in two years. They also NEVER came back to fix the damage it left on the walls and pillars, as evident by the water stain on our ceiling and paint that was bubbled. The foundation for the apartment is shifting as well. There were huge cracks in our walls from who knows what. Our sliding door on our patio would no longer shut correctly because the door frame was warped from the building's unrepaired structure (multiple times we put in requests to see what was going on with this. Nothing was fixed, just noted on our maintenance record) \n\nSounds great, right? There's more. So you can see how unprofessional they are, but how about unethical? They started bribing tenants to put in \"5 star\" reviews on yelp to get entered into raffles for iPods and other prizes. They also, recently, started asking new tenants to put in \"5 star\" reviews to get some fees taken off their move in costs. If you ran a sound business with great satisfaction, you wouldn't need to bribe people into giving you 5 star reviews, would you? Shame on any business that does this. And last, but not least, we are (at the time of writing this review 4/15/16) still waiting for our security deposit. Like I said, we ALWAYS paid rent on time, for 6 years! And the one time we are LEGALLY due our deposit IN FULL within 30 DAYS of moving out (Nevada States Law NRS 118A.242), it has not arrived. We have called Jessi, the manager, multiple times and never received a call back from her. We received one email stating the refund has been \"processed\" but still no update on the status or postage date.They tell us they are short staffed and sound really sad on the phone but guess what? You are a business! Act like it. Don't make excuses, just fix issues. If I were to tell them 2 years ago that I had some personal problems and couldn't pay rent (which never happened, just example given) would they let me pay late or maybe within 7-10 business days? NO! They would have fined me and eventually evicted us if they didn't receive payment. These are not even all the issues we experienced but this about sums up our time there. It is not right that businesses don't care about the tenants after they have signed a lease because they know they have them locked. We should have moved out 2 years ago, that was our fault for staying so long. But we have now moved into a new apartment with better appliances and staff, 24hr armed security car patrol, maintenance requests that were taken care of within the same day... all for the same price we paid there! Do yourself a favor and look around and judge for yourself. I can tell you that we feel like Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption when he finally swims through the sewage drain and is free.

I asked the girl working at the reception if an appointment was neccessary for a cut and colour. She informed me that no, an appointment was not needed. She was nice, cheerful and informative. She told me about the current specials as well. I said that I would return the following day. \nThe next day, I returned to this location at 5:30 with a friend. We both said that we wanted a colour and cut. It was the same girl working at the front desk. She was disappearing, on and off the phone, and otherwise out to lunch - so to speak. She gave us forms to fill out with our contact information and told us it was an hour to an hour and a half wait - Really, no appointments? She then got on the phone and made herself unavailable. My friend and I stood there waiting for someone to assist us. Eventually, the instructor, who had been busy doing another sudent's highlights in plain view, came over to take our forms and she said she would call us when our spot was open. \nMy friend and I went to some shops in the plaza to kill time. 6:45 rolls around and we still hadn't gotten a call. We went back into the school (I don't want to call it a salon...) and let the front desk staff know we were back. We waited until 7... Nothing. They wouldn't even give us an estimate on the time. They said there were two people ahead of us. I struck up conversation with a woman who was also waiting. She said she also came in arounf 5:30 - for a ROOT TOUCH UP - and was STILL waiting. She made a good point... she could have gone home and done it herself in that time. I approached the desk around 7:15 and spoke to a student, the same student who was getting highlights done in her own hair earlier. She told me that as soon as she was done - and pointed to her own hair - she would help me. Um... ok.\nAt 7:30, we were still not served or given a time that we would be. I approached the desk and informed them we had been waiting 2 HOURS and that this was entirely unacceptable and bullsh-t. The same instructor that was doing highlights on the student earlier had only said \"I do apologize.\" I told her she should be teaching these students professionalism and correct customer service, neither which was present in this place.  I also let her know that I completely understood that this was a SCHOOL and not a salon, and that I therefore knew it would be a little slower but that it was common sense to let their customers know what was going on as we had been waiting. she kept saying \"I do apologize\"... nothing else. I asked once again what the time frame for waiting would be. She then said half an hour to an hour. I asked her if she was for real... to which she said yes. I then told her we are NOT waiting three hours for this... and told her to dispose of our contact sheets that we initially filled out. I told her, now with an audience of two students - one who was the girl working the front desk - that I had attended this location the previous day and thought the prices, staff and reviews looked good. I told her I had recommended this location to my friends and family to check out. I then explained that I would retract that and that I would never recommend it again.\n\nWhat a terrible experience.

The Palms is known for their big party suites--why else would you rent a big party suite if you were NOT going to have a party?

The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.\n\nI am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.\n\nCOBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!\n\nNow the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex\n\nI first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.\n\nI then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.\n\nI then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.\n\nWhen I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.\n\nFinally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.\n\nI went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.\n\nThe next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. \n\nI knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.\n\nI suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.\n\nAs a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.\n\nI went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. \n\nThey reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.\n\nJared to the rescue:\n\nI took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.\n\nLesson: NEVER GO TO THE 7700 LOCATION! ALWAYS GO TO THE 616 LOCATION!\n\nCOBBLESTONE, BAD MANAGERS MAKE FOR A BAD STAFF.

Basically, charcuterie is a series of meaty products (cured, whipped & other preparation techniques) served on a wooden platter.\nAll offered with a pile of full-seeded mustard, a dish of teeny-tiny pickled vegetables, and we ordered Thuet Bread on the side. The Thuet bread was soft & fresh - a great accompaniment.\nThe star was the foie gras mousse - whipped to perfection, it just melts in your mouth.\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow ($9)\nHollowed with a little spoon & sprinkled with a bit of coarse salt on top of warm, smoky bread, this was tasty and good for the immune system. I reminded myself of the health benefits as I savoured each bit of fatty, rich, comforting flavour.\n\nTongue in Brioche ($13)\nThe sandwich was a ridiculously generous portion of thinly sliced beef tongue between two plump slices of fragrant brioche, all held together with a skewered cornichons. A healthy (hah!) dose of mustard and tarragon mayo drizzled all over made my heart skip - whether it was in fear or excitement, I'm still not sure.\nIncredibly soft and tender, prior to this delight I didn't know that tongue could be this delectable. While I prefer the buttery & decadent Tongue Grilled Cheese at Hoof Cafe, I would never turn down this sandwich.\n\nRaw Horse Sammy w/ Hot Sauce ($22)\nFresh bread topped with horse tartar with a raw egg yolk & shallots on one slice, and a liberal helping of hot sauce on the other. The \"HORSE\" spelled out in sauce was a fun touch. I couldn't believe how tasty the raw horse meat was - I tried it with and without the hot sauce & bread to get a sense of the true flavour.\n\nVisit #2\nCrispy Pig Ear Salad\nStrips of breaded & deep-fried pig ears over radishes, carrots, edible flowers with a lime buttermilk dressing\nI liked the pig ears, but I found the dressing too buttery and generous on the salad. As someone who prefers light, acidic dressing (or none at all with the right greens!) it was unappetizing. However, I was at the Black Hoof so this was to be expected.\nThe pig ears were crispy as advertised, and full of fatty-flavour with each bite. A dining companion claims that Buca does a better version...\n\nFluke Crudo\nFluke along with charred fava beans, avocado cream, sliced chili, pancetta, herbs & cilantro dressing.\nI really liked the avocado cream and fava beans. A little heavy on the dressing (but again, it's Hoof!) but the combination of the sliced chili & cilantro was delightful with the fish. Love the plating :)\n\nN'Duja & Corn Tagliatelle\nHouse tagliatelle noodles with charred corn, charred cherry tomatoes, and the n'duja which is a spicy calabrese salami melted into the pan. Garnished with a green onion salad on top.\nMmm. I realy enjoyed this - house pasta was al dente and the creamy sauce blended very well with the charred corn and tomatoes. I still have trouble pronouncing it, but the n'duja was quite tasty with a bit of heat and I would happily order this dish again. Creamy, spicy, & corny goodness. I love sweet corn!\n\nPork Belly, Squid,& Melon\nBaby squid, Berkshire pork belly & chunks of melon in a watermelon glaze with turmeric, cumin. Flaxseed, Vietnamese cilantro, mint, & basil also riddle this succulent dish.\nWhile the pork belly and the squid were both well done and delicious, the pairing did not do much for each other. They were enjoyed separately with the watermelon glaze. I must have gotten a good chunk of watermelon, as a dining partner-in-crime said she didn't taste the melon but I certainly did. As usual, the pork belly made me pause to fully enjoy the flavour. So decadent and perfectly pan-cooked.\n\nCalf's Brain Ravioli\nHouse ravioli in sage, brown sugar, & butter sauce with Parmesan shavings\nSo...It was an oily mess, and I was very glum as a result. From the poor presentation, meagre calf brain filling, blah pasta, and too-sharp cheese I reluctantly ate all 5 raviolis wondering why I was even bothering with each bite. It was cooked al dente, just like the tasty tagliatelle, but I don't think that that is the best way to cook ravioli. Sigh. A fellow diner sampled a bit of my dish and agreed that it was simply not good. Darn it. But that's 1 bad dish out of so many amazing ones...so all is forgiven =)\n\nPics: http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/2010/08/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.html\nPics: http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/2010/09/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.html", "cool": 1, "date": "2010-09-11", "funny": 1, "review_id": "7WNFDEMY0_hFO_EWROecJg", "business_id": "pZ1quwXnYozLIZIVABojhw", "stars": 4, "user_id": "WNAXTApcsMqobkZ8z9LJcA", "useful": 2}, {"text": "Decent hotel rooms but casino and layout are horrible.

It's Saturday and at 12:01 PM, we are already lined up at the Priest. It's cozy, nuff said. The smell is great, just enough to start the salivation process. The fresh meat is nicely formed into balls up, as each serving awaits it's transformation. I chat with some other patrons, it must be my good looks, because others are asking me what this is and what that is. I reply quickly, I am a Burger Priest virgin. I order a double-double for my significant other and 'The Priest\" for myself. Somehow this seems wrong, given my strict catholic upbringing and years as an alter boy. Then my world is shattered. The mushroom fryer is broken. OH THE HUMANITY. So I opt for the double-double and an order of fries. I go for tomatoe, onion and mayo. Let the burger sing it's own song people. It's juicy, the meat flavour is there. Nice crisp on the patty and a minimal bun. It's good, but where are the angels, the path to the white light? Still waiting. Could you and I make these burgers at home? Of course. Is this the holy trinity of meat, bun and add ons, as others have stated? Not in my opnion, or at least not yet. Are they good, absolutely. Eating out is not just about convenience, we are after all, social creatures. It's partially the experience and the thought that an individual at the stove will take our taste buds and our spirit to another level. I will be back at \"The Priest\" someday and am looking forward to giving them 5 stars. God willing.

We were even in his office right before they were closing and he didn't shoo us out the door.  We ended up taking the quote home and sitting on it for a month.

And we did!!\n\nWhen our project kicked off, our project manager, David, and John met with us at home and walked us through the entire process.  They even had this cool little website where we could track dates and milestones.  Once it got started, it went very quickly!

I thought that reserving a room like that over the phone (and even paying for a night up front!) would get me the room I needed but no, there is no way to be sure that you're getting what you want or pay for at this place.\n The check-in procedure took AN HOUR thanks to an incompetent chump and sassy desk manager (she started giving me attitude like it was my fault they didn't have my room available!  wtf?) while my girlfriend sat out in the car, surrounded by drunks, in their driveway.  If that wasn't bad enough, this front desk hassle made us too late for my special birthday dinner!  Where I had a hook-up!  This was the first night in Vegas and already Mandalay Bay was losing me time and money!\n That night, I tried to put our expensive leftovers into a fridge but discovered that the only mini-fridge in the room was full of beverages that you couldn't move or else the computerized weight system would charge you immediately.  So, no fridge!  Even Super 8 has a mini-fridge!  We went to bed that night enraged.\n The next night we ordered $22 nachos from room service (there was a $5 \"cover charge\" ... just another cutthroat fee at this place).  I didn't get the room service guy's name because I was too busy staring at - seriously - LESIONS on his face, neck, and even wrist!  It wasn't acne, it was some kind of exczema or something.  I've never not eaten nachos before in my life, that night was a total waste of food and money.  Why hire room service guys who destroy your appetite!?  Isn't that a health code violation too?\n Finally, I was looking forward to talking to the front desk as I checked out.  The clerk asked the people in front of me \"did you enjoy your stay with us?\" so I figured that would be my opportunity to let Mandalay Bay know that it was really not an accomodating place to stay.  However, the front desk clerk just checked me out without even talking and moved right on to the next in line with cold dead eyes.  I should have stayed and asked for a manager but I was honestly too tired and frustrated to fight.  \n \"Disappointed\" cannot even begin to describe our stay at Mandalay Bay.  I had hoped to take my birthday party there this summer for their awesome pools but there's no way I'm going to put up with their incompetent, scuzzy staff, poor reservation schedule, and counterproductive accomodations.

The menu is a full three panel - front and back - array of original creations, ranging from the unique and beautiful Lazy Sundaes to the Scoop du Jour - one or two scoops with cream and cherries.  Of course, you can also just select from the many offered toppings and ice cream flavours to create-your-own.  Ice cream includes peanut butter, nutello chocolate (not to be confused with Nutella) and vanilla-honey, amongst others.  On top of that, they throw in a freshly made crepe or waffle, some bananas or strawberries, chocolate sauce and a couple of dollops of the clearly-in-house-made whipped cream, and you have a dessert that will put you in a delightful sugar coma!\n\nIt was close to 11:00 p.m. when I made my way to Demetre's, but there were still a good number of sweet-toothed patrons enjoying some of the sugary creations - this was clearly be more than your regular two-scoop waffle-cone kind of place.  They make all of the ice creams on the premises, using fresh Ontario dairy and utilizing a special freezing process that prevents ice crystals from forming in the carefully crafted artisan frozen treats.\n\nThe servings provide you more than enough ice cream and extras to share comfortably, but my group decided to be gluttonous and each have their own; three ice cream crepe dishes, one with peanut butter ice cream, one nutello chocolate and one with the house chocolate.  The best thing about these desserts, right down to the whipped cream, is the balance of sweetness with the bold flavours.  There is a truly special way they do things that prevents the strong flavours from overwhelming the whole dish.  The peanut butter ice cream was nowhere near that almost sticky consistency and too-rich taste that can be attached to some PB creations; the whipped cream was a clean and creamy compliment to the light chocolate syrup; and the fruit was fresh and surprisingly bright considering the winter months.\n\nI am a self-proclaimed cheap dessert-eater, but here I felt like I got much more than I paid for.  The dishes come in at about $10 each - but, if you're sharing, which is probably more appropriate than polishing off a whole plate alone, it is quite affordable - especially for the top-notch quality.\n\nThe cherry on top was the service.

She was lovingly cared for, allowed to roam the yard, and fed fresh corn and barley. How do I know? The other day I was going to my neighbourhood grocery store to buy a whole chicken. You know the type of bird I mean. It sits in those refrigerated, glass boxes at the back of the store; the only indication it was ever a chicken at all is the familiar sight of wings and breast meat. As its lifeless body sits there, I can't ever imagine this thing having feathers, breathing, living. Truth be told, buying that chicken is a mostly unceremonious experience that people rarely give a second thought to.\n\nBut something spectacular happened to me that day. I didn't buy that chicken; I didn't even get to the grocery store. On my way there, I noticed the Butcher by Nature storefront, and I felt compelled to check it out and see what all this 'By Nature' business was all about.\n\nButcher by Nature gives life to that lifeless chicken. Much like purchasing pedigree, the butcher and owner, Frank, knew all about my chicken and all the other chickens he was selling for that matter. He knew the farmers personally, and he knew that they were passionate about raising animals. He spoke proudly about the pesticide-free and natural-focused environment the farmers raised their livestock in. Clearly, this is a different kind of eating.\n\nThe shop is fairly small, but truly cozy, and the store is classic with more butchery area than retail shop. The retail area has shelves lined with locally-sourced dry products, like jams and honey, and fridges lined with locally-sourced meat products, like duck and eggs. Butcher by Nature also has a passionate, knowledgeable owner. Actually, forget that last bit; calling Frank knowledgeable is an understatement. The art and science of butchery is seemingly ingrained in his bones. Much like those chicken's proud lineage, Frank was raised to do butchery.\n\nPesticide-free, hormone-void, locally-sourced meats, combined with an experienced owner and a pleasant store-front is what Butcher by Nature is all about. And of course, they're not limited to just chickens. They carry quite a large variety of meat including duck, venison, pork, and beef; all of it butchered and prepared in a bunch of different ways.\nFear not. Eating all this organic natural stuff isn't for just the rich. In fact, most of the products at Butcher by Nature are actually reasonably priced. In most cases, you can expect to pay just a few bucks more than you would at the neighbourhood grocery store. That, combined with the absolute passion surrounding what they carry makes it an easy choice for meat. Even if you're not in the area, Butcher by Nature is worth the trip.\n\nSo, if you think that chickens, or most other animals for that matter, magically end up in refrigerated, glass boxes at the back of a grocery store, then you owe it to yourself to check out Butcher by Nature because when it comes to meat, it's all about where it comes from.", "cool": 2, "date": "2011-05-25", "funny": 0, "review_id": "SSM8AKnHtAk7Ajdp5wgMeA", "business_id": "MzjfSbFFTEVlX4Lp2kHg_Q", "stars": 5, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "useful": 5}, {"text": "- It wasn't that long ago that Bloordale was a strip of Toronto that felt neglected. In fact, most people may feel like its still neglected, but looking around, it's evident that there are signs of improvement. That's where Three Speed comes in. Located unseemingly near Pauline on Bloor street West, they definitely took a risk opening up in this somewhat seedy Toronto neighbourhood. But regardless the risk, it seems to have worked for them. Packed nightly with 20-something hipsters, it's difficult to get a seat if you show up past 8 or 9 o'clock, but don't let any of that stop you. As far as 'Blansdowne' goes, bar-wise there just isn't much that competes with it. \n\nThree Speed is brought about by the same people that started the Communist's Daughter, and they also have some affiliation with The Dakota, so you can expect the same sorta crowd and atmosphere--and dare I say pretentiousness--that you'd expect to see in any of those spots. If you can find the dam place that is...\n\nThree Speed is difficult to notice. In fact, if you weren't directly looking for it or didn't know where it was, you'd probably go right past; and if it wasn't for the red lights strung about the front window spiking my curiousity, I probably wouldn't have ever discovered it either. So when you're walking around Bloor and Lansdowne, and you finally do find it and get inside, the hidden-factor sorta gives the feel of a Bloordale oasis.\n\nThe inside of Three Speed is not what you'd expect by the near-crumbling exterior. Inside it's dimly lit, low-key, and seriously comfortable. With exposed brick, wood panels, and art galore, it's an easy place to want to hang out at.\n\nScribbled on a chalkboard and suspended on the bar wall, Three Speed has a slightly random food menu that displays their feature items, like mussels served in 1 of 3 styles,  Lo, Med, and High, indicating 'speed' but not content. You can expect well-rounded flavours of lime, fennel, and roasted garlic. No mistake, these are mighty good mussels.  But if there's a bunch of you, and mollusks aren't your thing, I'd recommend the Party Plate. It's a nice spread of cheese, meat, and pickled goodness. If you're not the sharing type, I'd go with the sirloin burger. Although I've definitely had better, this is still a savoury and sizeable burger that won't disappoint you.\n\nLike I said, it feels like the neighbourhood is on the mend and slowly losing its feel of neglect. There are even a few other cool spots that followed suit and opened up in this neighbourhood, like Holy Oak and the Starving Artist; both businesses that are beginning to do well.\n\nIf you're in the Bloordale area, hanging out at Three Speed is an easy, but slowly becoming not the only option. But the fact remains, these people have taken a crappy, ex-Karaoke dump in a less-than-desirable neighbourhood and turned it into something special that is directly impacting the culture of Bloordale and for that, they definitely deserve to be commended.

There's a Joe Fresh and an LCBO upstairs, on the main floor is where the party's really at. So, at your local grocery stores, or even superstores, you've got your grocery isles, and deli, pastry, artisan, etc. sections, right? Cool.\nThis place has a CHEESE WALLL DOE. Tell me how many grocery stores you've seen with a CHEEESE WALL. They have not a deli section per say, more of a deli CIRCLE. Also, they have a Tea Emporium, a CHOCOLATIER (WHATTT!!), a bakery section with more variety, and selection than most bakeries that are devoted to just being a bakery has, there's a sushi corner, a cafe, talking holographic mannequin type signs, a salad WALL, opposed to the overplayed and boring salad bar, sitting areas smack in the middle of the entire store, artisan breads area, and the list goes O N N N N. They even give out samples of food, almost like a prettier, miniature version of costco.\nNow, you're leaving the interactive specialty section to get to the actual grocery store.\nIt has rows upon rows upon rows of everything, and anything your heart desires (within grocery store reason obviously). The lighting in here is brilliant, the isles are wide, the colours are vibrant! Albeit, an ugly orange, but vibrant nonetheless.\nThey also offer underground parking, and there's escalators to get up to the shopping level. What about my cart full of groceries? You ask. Fear not!

Friendly. \n\nThe dentists are thorough and the hygienist is probably the nicest hygienist you will ever meet. The Doctors are great. You can always depend on them to be honest with you. Options are always given. Sometimes appointments start a little late but when they do take you in you are out just as quickly. I have only met the lady doctor once before and it was pleasant but Dr.Michael is usually the one I see when I get a check up and he is quick and efficient.\n\nThe hygienist is very honest, patient and thorough. She wants to know how she can make your experience better throughout the appointment. She always welcomes you with a smile and leaves you with the receptionist with a smile. The experience is completely different from dental offices 15-20 years ago. My whole family, including my kids, love her. You can see the difference when you sit with Karen because she cares. My first appointment with the office several years ago started with her. I used to hate dental offices and Karen completely reassured that dental offices are not something to fear. She actually said to my son \"Am I scary?\" which she is not, she knew how to diffuse a \"scary\" moment. She is gentle when cleaning and thorough. \n\nOverall atmosphere is great.

I have very fine eyebrow hairs and went to Julia for microblading in the hopes of having beautiful, hassle-free eyebrows.  The result is that I am emotionally distraught and aesthetically maimed with mis-matched eyebrows now because of Julia's work.\n\nI take responsibility for not doing significantly more research before deciding on someone to do my microblading, or I certainly would not have selected Julia.  She lacks close-up photos of her work, has only 3 reviews on Yelp, and not many more on her website where she can cherry-pick the best ones.  But shame on Julia for trying to convince me that her microblading on my brows looked great, and that what I was seeing in the mirror was \"just a reflection\" and not what my brows really looked like.  Her analysis would be laughable if it was not so flawed and deeply upsetting.\n\nI last saw Julia about a month ago for a touch-up to the original work where she promised to \"even out my brows and make them perfect.\" She did not improve the mismatched shapes at all, but only made them darker which I did not want.  Since then I have had numerous consulting appointments with professional microbladers and have heard a consistent theme to date... that my brows are definitely mismatched with one having a high arch mid-way in the brow, while the other is relatively flat with a rounded arch at the end; additionally, I've been told the brows are over-saturated so that the individual hairs are not visible which is the whole point of microblading to achieve natural looking brows.\n\nI can only pray that my brows lighten and completely disappear over the next few years.  At that point, if they have not completely faded, I will need to resort to time-consuming and expensive saline treatments to remove Julia's work before I can have my brows properly microbladed.  \n\nIn the meantime, each morning I must re-shape each brow with a brow pencil to get a closer match so that I'm not embarrassed to go out.  Needless to say, the past several months have been emotionally devastating to me and I don't know what the future holds.\n\nJulia has offered to \"fix my brows\" if I come in for a third appointment.

The combination was the most bizarre-sounding yet one of the best I've ever had. The sorbet was sweet and cold with a red onion twist. And initially, it seemed strange with the hot and cold, but it was perfect. The lightness, sweetness and tartness of the sorbet counter-balanced the fois gras. If I could go into a Baskin Robbins and ask for a red onion sorbet I would. I could easily eat 10 of these. The only other appetizer that can rival this for me is Michael Mina's tuna tartare.\n\nThe lobster pasta was nice and light despite being pasta. The serving size was just right, giving me a great taste of it but not over the top so that I felt uncomfortably full after (with not enough space for the rest of the menu). They gave a good-sized lobster claw and with the al dente paste, perfection again.\n\nThe beef cheek was incredibly tender - cooked just right. It was tender and juicy, on a bed of potato mash and gravy. I love beef tongue and the texture was similar, except it was a thicker meat. This was also very rich.\n\nLastly, the chocolate ganache was lovely as well. The coffee grinds and maple ice cream were a nice compliment and the ganache itself, light and slightly rich. \n\nSome friends also had the wine pairing ($95 for the tasting menu and $45 for the wine pairing) and the wines (including an icewine at dessert) they said were perfectly complimentary. They said the chianti served with the beef cheek was just right.\n\nMy husband was the only one not ordering the tasting menu - we were told that the signature ravioli was one of the best dishes so he decided to get that. He loved (and so did I). I would come back and try that as my main next time.\n\nThe service and atmosphere here were bar none. The server thoroughly explained each wine we ordered (including the single servings) and when our food was brought to us (we were a party of 8), there were 3 to 4 servers who laid our food down so that the rest of the table wasn't always kept waiting. Even as one of us went to the washroom, a server just passing by would pick up our napkin left on the seat and fold it nicely, leaving it back on the table for us. \n\nI'm so glad we came here and I would definitely recommend this restaurant and come back.

They ask you if you need a ride somewhere incase you don't want to wait and if you are waiting they will direct you to their lounge and inform you of all the amenities that they have. If they told you it will be done in 45mins it usually gets done. But if not you usually get a call informing you of the situation and apologizing for making you wait more than you should.

They want to take your hard earned money to benefit themselves.  They stole money from me.  They took hundreds of dollars from me for no reason at all.

I love a good burger, and with the wide array of options shown on Streat Burger's menu, I was pretty confident that I'd walk out happy.\n\nThis wasn't the case, unfortunately.\n\nI have no complaints about the service. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating, but the food was another story.\n\nI ordered a Brokeback burger with the BBB (that's their burger and bacon blend patty) and my wife had a plainsville turkey burger. We ordered the fried pickle chips and fried cheese curds as an appetizer. \n\nIt took longer than expected for the apps to come out, but the server acknowledged this saying that the pickle chips had to be made twice, and she apologized. It didn't bother me much, as I was happy sipping on a Portside vanilla stout (they have a pretty good beer list).\n\nWhen we did get the appetizers, the first thing I noticed was that the \"cheese curds\" were the size of mozzarella sticks. I can only begin to imagine what an abomination their poutine is if that's what they serve with it. Also, the \"marinara\" sauce that came with the \"cheese curds\" was more of a paste than a sauce. We ended up using the sauce that came with the pickle chips instead, which was significantly better. \n\nThe pickle chips themselves, however, were probably some of the worst I've had. It was mostly dough with very thin pickle chips. I barely got any of the briney, pickley flavor, but I got plenty of greasy doughy flavor.\n\nThe burgers, the reason this place should be known and loved, were probably the most disappointing aspect of the meal. My burger was flavorful enough, but that was mainly because of all the toppings. In fact, that's all I could taste as the BBB was very thin and dry. There was no juiciness, thickness, or beefiness to be found in this anemic patty. What a shame.\n\nI didn't try the turkey burger my wife had, but she said that it was mushy. Our side of fries were nothing to write home about either. The weren't crisp and were slightly under-done.\n\nI really hope this place shapes up, because right now, there are much better options out there in the Cleveland area vying for a burger lover's attention (B-Spot, Flip Side, Dynomite).

After putting in my order they said that the kitchen was a little backed up with orders and that my pizza would be there within 45 minutes to an hour. Thinking that we had some time to kill before the pizza got there, I decided to set an alarm for 45 minutes and got some shut eye. 45 minutes later my alarm went off, but no pizza had yet arrived. I then waited another 20 minutes to give them some leeway. No pizza as of 2:00 AM. I called and they answered. I asked about my pizza and they clearly told me \"It's just out of the oven and on its way out. It will be there in 10 minutes.\"\n\n30 minutes pass and no pizza. At that time I was understandably upset and decided to call to cancel my order. I called and the line just kept ringing. I began to call again for the next 10 minutes and I never got an answer, not even a machine.\n\nBeing so tired that I was no longer hungry, I decided to go to sleep so I could catch my flight in the daytime. That was at 3:00 AM.\n\nNext thing I know there's a loud banging on my door. I look at my clock at the time is 4:00 AM!!! And alas, my pizza had finally arrived along with the rest of my friends from the club. Funny thing is first thing my friends said was \"The delivery guy just tried to sell us your pizza while in the elevator for $20.\" By now, every single person would be pissed off out of their mind. I talk with the delivery guy and calmly say \"The pizza is over 2 hours late. 3 hours from since I had ordered it. I do not want it, and I do not want to pay for it.\" He gives me a blank stare and all he says is \"Are you serious?\" as if I am not in my right mind to be doing this to him. He goes on to say that it is not his fault, but obviously someone screwed up. I tell him that I am not paying for it and for him to refund me back my money. He leaves, but not without cursing at me.\n\nThree days later a charge of $37 goes through onto my account from Pizza Di Roma for a pizza that was 3 hours late and I didn't even get.

However, we were scolded for not lacing up in the right location. You MUST stay on the black walkway/bench area once you have your skates on. Would have been helpful to know that when we sat down & started the whole process. Perhaps directional arrows on the ground or sign or two saying \"lace-up here\" or a simple \"DON'T put skates on here\" would avoid this issue. Be sure to hit up the beverage stand BEFORE you put your skates on because you can't walk across the cement to get to it once you're laced up. \nAfter we actually made it on the real ice we had a lot of fun. We only skated for about an hour or so but 2 hours would have been exhausting. ;)  I'd definitely go back so I could take a ride on the Princess Express train to see ALL of the holiday lagoon lights & displays.

The set up is about the same: $30 cover($20 admission+$10 fee for non-alcoholic drinks).  However if you get coupons from the publications on the strip, the $20 is waved and all you'll have to pay is $10 fee for drinks.  But don't forget to tip the waitress at least a buck every time they bring you a drink.\n\nWent there on a Friday night around 10pm during CES and AVN weekend.  The place was already packed probably because it doesn't have as many general sittings as Deja_Vu while it tries to get ppl to pay up for the VIP seats.  However, the manager wasn't pushy and we didn't have to stand around and wait too long for a table.  I heard the club opens till 6am so when I left around 1am, there was around 10/15 ppl waiting in line to get in.\n\nOverall I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of girls; maybe because I wasn't expecting much.  I would say a few of them are 6s, with most being 7s in terms of looks and body; there were even a few 8s.  The girls aren't too pushy for private dances; most of them just stand around instead of working the club more.  If you do get a lap dance, be sure to ask how much; some dancers ask for $20 and some $40 so your mileage varies.  There were a lot of opportunities for 2 for 1 dances and even a dollar dance for those sitting under the stage.  The stages were centrally located with good views from anywhere and the girls can really work the poles compared to what I've seen from Sapphires, Seamless, CrazyHorse II(now closed).  Love the way they climb all the way to the top and then spin down; what a sight! :)  The restroom(men) also has an attendant so you might want to have a dollar in hand so you can tip him and not be awkward.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time there since the girls are cute/friendly/not pushy and even the waitresses are very courteous; a few waitress were hot too but too bad they don't dance. :P  I'd definitely go back again to Little Darlings since their girls are pretty good looking and with some real dance skills.  Instead of going to the mega clubs like Spearmint or Sapphires, I find smaller clubs like Little Darlings/Deja_Vu a better value.  So if you're undedecided, give Little Darlings a try before you dismiss it.  Hope you will have a good time too.", "cool": 2, "date": "2011-01-08", "funny": 1, "review_id": "C6jYxQ9fJjXqUdmwC18vkg", "business_id": "oIFMGuV8C8yeaDrtwjc8Jw", "stars": 4, "user_id": "ePO4ikhERJn8APs0cK4S5w", "useful": 6}, {"text": "Worst Service I have ever had.

She even cleared it with a male manager.\n\nWe proceeded to be seated close to the buffet which was nice since I was hobbling already from over doing it walking on the strip earlier that evening.  As soon as our waiter came by he asked about drinks I told him 3, he asked how many we're eating and I again said 3.  He looked at the receipt and noticed we payed for 2.  I told him what the cashier had done and he said ok and walked away.\n\n5 minutes later a female manager walked over and told me we would have to pay the $17.99 for my daughter to eat.  I said I would talk to my wife and we would handle it, she said ok and left.  Our waiter, who clearly must have ownership in the buffet came by again and was looking for the receipt that we paid for my daughter, I told him we had not yet, at that time my wife came to the table and informed him that the male manager had approved it, our waiter/owner said the manager has no right to approve, such a drain on the business and cash income of such a struggling establishment, ok he just said the manager had no right to approve that.\n\nSo now our appetite is ruined, we are pissed and I want to kill our self important arrogant bastard of a waiter.

The Skinny fries were unremarkable but I did find myself nibbling at my brother's sweet potato fries which I actually liked better than the Skinny fries (and I don't normally prefer sweet potato fries).\n\nWe were seated immediately (didn't like our table and were shown to a booth without hesitation by the hostess) and our server appeared right away to take our drink orders (lots of beer to choose from).  Drinks arrived quickly and our orders were taken efficiently and all of our menu questions were answered cheerfully with enough detail for us to decide.  The servers all around seemed like they like to work there; she checked on us peridocially but didn't seem intrusive.\n\nThe place had the up-beat vibe of a sports bar (screens all over the place including a small flat-panel in our booth) and the buzz that comes with a lot of tourists--it's Vegas, after all--oh, and there were a couple of crying kids but we were too into our food so they were drowned out plus it's so big, asking to be moved should not be a problem.\n\nI would like to go back, or maybe hit the Burger Bar in my hometown, to try the Rossini burger: for $60.00 you get Kobe beef, saut\u00e9ed foie gras, shaved truffles, Madeira sauce, on onion bun.", "cool": 1, "date": "2009-10-27", "funny": 1, "review_id": "BpfI52E3JkNIqE_6lxih5A", "business_id": "Cni2l-VKG_pdospJ6xliXQ", "stars": 4, "user_id": "_D0fpoWGQt3_-FGYLWuntg", "useful": 2}, {"text": "I went here on a whim last night for a date and couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised!

Just a couple days ago, (7/13/2016) I receive a call from a collections company stating that I have a bill that was never paid that they are working to collect on. 19 months later and this is the first I have heard anything! I do not pay my bills late and I have an excellent credit standing. All of the bills I received from the hospital for the birth of my baby have been paid in full. I never received a bill from Palm Tree Pediatrics because if I had it would have been paid. So I ask the collections agent why I never received a bill and she states that they had a bad address and the bills were undelivered. The address Palm Tree Pediatrics had was an address that the hospital had on file from 31 years ago when my mother had me at Thunderbird Samaritan (now Banner Thunderbird). I actually never lived at that address. I gave the hospital my new address SEVERAL times and all my other hospital bills made it to my home and were paid. Palm Tree Pediatrics wants to charge me a collection fee because they sent this bill to collections without verifying my address or calling to confirm it afterwards. They have another complaint on Yelp.com regarding a bill being sent to collections and it seems they have too many clients and just send everything to collections without following proper procedures to verify addresses. I should not be held responsible for a collections fee as I provided Banner Del Webb with the correct address and had Dr. Babarinde asked for my address, this would not have been an issue. Banner Del Webb sent me all the hospital bills to the correct address with no problem. Her staff (Athena and Tabitha in billing) are unreasonable and would rather charge me a collection fee than to have a happy client. I actually heard Athena in billing tell someone else in the office \"she won't shut up\" (referring to me) while I was on the phone with her!

This was on a Monday, so when we arrived about 8pm, it wasn't very crowded.  The d\u00e9cor is a little over the top, but most steakhouses tend to be that way.  The menu had lots of options, but seemed pricey.  We decided to stay and give it a try.\n\nOut of our group, we ordered 2 steaks.  I ordered a large prime rib to split with my wife and my 8 year-old daughter got the kids sirloin (I would guess It was a 4oz steak).  An hour passed and I had gotten my salad and we had gotten some bread and that was about it.  Finally, after another 10-15 minutes, we got our meals.  My daughter's steak was raw and the prime rib was an end cut and was dry and well done through about half of the cut and then a light pink in the very middle only and overall very dry.  Not the way a prime rib should be cooked.\n\nI proceeded to tell the waitress about the steaks and she offered to bring us 2 more.  I told her we couldn't wait another hour for our steaks and she said she would get them out as soon as possible.  At this point, the manager/owner came over and told me he thought the prime rib looked fine and he would throw the small sirloin back on the grill.  He also stated that the delay was because they cook the meat to order.  First of all, you don't cook a prime rib to order.  They should already be close to the correct temperature and then finished off as the orders come in.  It was obvious that the piece was cut off an uncooked prime rib that was in the fridge and then put in the oven to cook it quickly and then put on the grill to finish it.  It was cooked and well done on all sides, so there was no cut from the rest of the rib.  My daughter's steak was only 4oz, so how long does that take to cook?  I don't see that it would take an hour for what we ordered, so he tried to tell us something that wasn't true.\n\nThe point is that he wanted to argue with me that the prime rib was fine when it was burnt and crusty on the outside and dry on the inside.  He lost that argument as we decided to leave until he handed me a check for a salad, drinks and the side my wife had ordered to go with the prime rib.  Another 15 minutes passed until clearer heads prevailed and the lady at the front told us to not worry about it.\n\nI will never come back when he tried to give us a line about the delays and the quality of the food.  You shouldn't offer something you aren't prepared to present with your best quality.  Cutting the end of a prime rib and trying to make it a prime rib in an hour doesn't work and just frustrates your customers.  Don't lie and just tell the truth.  We would have stayed and tried to enjoy our meal if you just hadn't want to come over and argue with us about our meal.\n\nPoor customer service, overpriced food for the quality and long waits just aren't worth it.

I had originally taken my tv in for repair back in December of 2002, and found what they actually did to fix the pcb, in Aug of 2008.

I love the culture and the plethora of cuisine that different regions of India have to offer. Out of the MANY Indian places I have tried throughout Las Vegas, Taste of India is THE WORST facility I have ever tried. There are many reasons why.\n\nFirst and foremost, the food. \nAs I entered the place, it was almost completely empty, with only one other table occupied. (they were family of the business). As I chose a table, I walked over to scan the \"buffet\" quickly and was very surprised at what I saw. There was one isle of food, not a great selection to choose from, but just the basics such as chicken korma, tikka masala, jeera rice, etc. All the food I saw looked incredibly unappetizing. I should have left right then and there, but I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. BIG MISTAKE.\nI noticed the food that almost no one has touched, literally caked on the sides of the metal bins that they were sitting in. All the food was above the temperature basin therefore it had dried out from it sitting there most likely for HOURS. All the condiments were sitting in melted ice and looked like they were just thrown in their bin. There were also a couple of flies sitting in them. I was utterly disgusted. \nAt this point I really wanted to feed my insatiable need for Indian food and personally would feel quite bad If I just left this new business. It was a stupid choice that I made.\nI decided to get the tikka masala and the palak paneer and some rice. \nI cannot even describe how bad this excuse for Indian food was. First, all the food that I tried was UNDER PROPER TEMPERATURE. The chicken tikka masala tasted like they mixed canned tomatoes with chicken. It was horrible and room temperature. The palak paneer was not even melted properly and the spinach almost separated from the unknown sauce that it consisted of. What was this?! \nThe rice was flavorless and mushy but clumping together. This means that chances are that this rice is RECYCLED. It was by no means, fresh. Everything tasted so very bland.\nI ordered naan, garlic and plain. It looked very fresh when the guy brought it out, but then I noticed that it was still very doughy. It was not even done baking all the way!\nI started to become very weary of the food that was in front of me, slowly scooping up bite minutes apart and then just giving up. Not even a half hour later I started to feel the effects of FOOD POISONING. Sure enough, it was. I got really sick throughout the day and was vomiting profusely. I was very ill for the next few days unfortunately. \n\nOverall, the food here was a horrible selection of Indian food. The quality is by far a sorry excuse for representing Indian cuisine and these people are INDIAN! I could make a better Indian dish at home and I'm Italian! I am surprised that the health department has not shut down this place for improper food temperatures. People should not be eating here for that reason alone. \nI could go on and on about this horrible restaurant, but I feel that people should be aware of places like this who care more about money than the quality of their food and misrepresenting what Indian cuisine is all about. This place is a shame.

My husband and I had reservations for two hours before we went to see a show that I've wanted to see for years. We had a Groupon that was two courses (burgers with sides and a dessert) with wine. We were seated (one of six tables with two servers, a manager and a bartender...so not exactly busy) and it took 20 minutes for a server to come by and get us water. We ordered the wine and were ready to order, but he said he'd get the wine first. We waited another 20 minutes. He came back over with the wine and took a good five minutes opening it, telling us that the manager was too busy to get the wine and he usually doesn't open the wine. He then was about to leave and I told him we'd like to order. He took our order and the food came out pretty quickly, about 15 minutes later. It was fine. Not as good as some of the other burger places in Vegas like Holsteins, Burgr or LBS. The fries tasted like they came out of a freezer bag. We ate and then sat another 20 minutes waiting for them to clear our table. When we finally ordered dessert, we waited another 20 minutes until I was livid because we were going to be late for our show. An hour and forty minutes for a one course meal?! Our server came out and told us that they didn't have the dessert we ordered, even though we saw it come out for other guests. They charged us for the extra side we ordered and tax and tip, but since we had to leave we never got the dessert that we had paid for. The manager and server were not apologetic and were quite rude. I would never, never go back to this place.

On my first day, the girl who was doing my nails was  condescending and the way she boasted about her quality of work was quite fascinating. Another consistent finding from previous reviews that matched my experience was the longevity of the gel nails. I first noticed them chipping off in 3 days time, and when I gave them a call to enquire about getting it re-done, the attitude of the staff threw me off as they weren't very convinced that the nail really came off in 3 days. They even went far to ask when I actually came in last time..  If you cannot do your job properly, at least admit to the fact that sometimes mistakes happen, then I would've stayed with them as I am very lenient.\nHonestly, the quality of the work itself isn't too bad, and I would recommend this place if you feel like throwing away $100 every 3 days to have a different design as that's all they will do. \nHere's little kicker for everyone..

The only thing SLOW was the service and smiles.  In a shopping center where stores are closing down left and right a smile can go a long way.  Instead we were ignored by the hostess who finally when deciding to realize that we were waiting for a table excused herself to locate us a place to sit on the patio.  \n\nMind you it was a Saturday and the patio was empty (sign of the times, or the food and service?).  She then returned 10 minutes later surprised to see us  still waiting for a table.  Her attitude towards us because of having young children with us was appalling.  It's a Cafe/Bistro not a 3 star Michelin restaurant that only serves dinner!  My 4 year olds manners are better than hers are.  The food was also nothing exceptional, panini shouldn't take 30 minutes when there are no other people at the restaurant except wannabe socialites sitting at the bar patio side.\n\nI would definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Tried 2 and both lacked the flavor to stand up to the rest of the burger.\n- Music was loud.  I understand going for the \"bar\" feel, but honestly it was hard to hear our server (or anyone else further than 2 ft from you).\n\nOther thoughts:\n- If you're looking for a plain burger, this may not be your place.  There's really nothing wrong with their burgers, but the thing that makes this place great is the extrordinary toppings.\n- If you've only had burgers at Chili's or Fudruckers type places, you may want to order your burger one doneness level up from your usual.

Beautiful.  \n\nExpensive.\n\nYeah it costs more than a few extra dollars to stay here, so if you're hoarding your readies to flay the stickmen at the craps table then perhaps the IP is a better option.  But to my mind, that money is far better-spent on the tasteful luxury and warm, welcoming atmosphere afforded to the lucky traveler who rests his head here.  You will want for nothing.  You will not spend 40 minutes checking in.  You will not have to navigate a crowded and smoky casino to access your room.\n\nI admit it.  The Mandarin has spoiled me for every other hotel on the strip.  Even options I had considered \"a step up\" in the past now seem hopelessly dreary.  But on a recent visit the tariff for my room was only 20 bucks more a night than what was surely a cramped shoebox at the sprawling and cacophonous MGM Grand.\n\nAnother perk...  after inquiring of the doorman how far a walk it was to the Cosmopolitan he responded with an estimate of 5-10 minutes or so, but if i could wait 5 minutes the house car would be available to drive me to my destination.

I was surprised by the less than average wait time. However, it quickly became clear as to the reason. The mousy intake nurse could not be bothered with conversation and appeared to be inconvenienced by my presence. The Nurse Practioner (NP) came to the exam room to  address my complaint. She spoke so quickly that I didn't catch her name. There were no notes in front of her from my intake or records about my health history for her to reference. I complained of acute pain and was sent to xray without any physical evaluation. After the xrays were read she returned only to tell me to go to my Primary Care Provider. (I'm at UC for a reason). Upon intake I mentioned that I've been taking Aleve for a month and that it's no longer effective and causing stomach problems. The NP stated that she would give me a steroid which would work for the pain. I left expecting to begin feeling relief from the script provided. Wrong. Come to find out, the steroid will take approximately two days to start relieving inflammation. As mentioned, I went to UC for a reason. I was still in pain and wanted to consult the NP further to determine what I could take considering my stomach issues (note that I was asking about OTC meds, not narcotics.) I contacted the number listed only to find out that you can't speak directly with the clinic. I waited for a call back which to my dismay was not from the NP, but the intake nurse. The nurse told me to continue to take Aleve. I reiterated my stomach issues and like a robot she repeated the information and assured me that's what the NP suggested. Hoping to speak with an individual that would answer my question I called back.  As mentioned, you can't speak with the clinic directly. Customer Service offered two solutions. 1. I can leave a voice mail with my complaints and if \"they\" find a problem they will call me back. 2. I would need to make a copay to see a different doctor. Once I  visited my PCP she was astonished that the NP would suggest Aleve despite stomach issues as they counteract. I have never been treated so poorly by someone practicing medicine.

It is actually the same pizza as their normal pizzas, you just get it for $5 from 12-4pm. I can't really comment on how pure of a \"NY\" pizza it is as I haven't been to NY, but it is thin crust and the slice is foldable which I think are some of the NY pizza prerequisites.\n\nThe garlic bread is the best I have tried in Las Vegas so far. It is not a \"bread\", it is served on a pizza crust and cut in long strips, it has very creamy and buttery taste with lots of cheese and the garlic does not overpower the crust or the cheese.\nDefinitely try the garlic bread, it was a revelation for me, in fact i order it every time, it's that good.\n\nBeing a Chicago pizza fan I also tried their Chicago style pizzas. Chicago for me is Giordano's, Lou Malnati's and Gino's East, not just a thick crust (like the horrendous Pizza Hut pan pizza). PMD's Chicago version is not the same but the crust is not thick at the bottom and it is crammed with toppings. Unlike true Chicago style the sauce doesn't go on top but there's plenty of cheese and the most amazing thing is it's not full of grease or oil dripping when you pick up a slice. It is very satisfying though and a 14\" pie can easily feed 3-4 people (or 2 with HUGE appetite).\n\nService is prompt and friendly. The place is small and only has 2 booths but I'd guess almost all orders are take out or delivery.\n\nOverall I love Pizza My Dear, they have great food, fresh ingredients, great price deals (also have many coupons and specials) and as long as I have ordered from them I have never been even slightly disappointed.

I was surprised to find that I could get beer from my old hometown of Burlington as well as Oakville next door - all the way to beers from around Ontario, Quebec (some excellent ones) and from around the world. I like that they normally use the traditional glasses used for the particular beers (hefeweissen glasses for hefeweissen beer, glasses from the particular brewers of the beer etc.). The variety of on-tap and bottled beers is excellent, and I usually try one new beer each time we go. \n\nThe service has always been excellent with very friendly (and knowledgeable) servers who seem genuinely happy to be there, and Erin (the very cheerful owner) ensuring that the service and drinks/food are all ok and that everyone is happy.  \n\nWe are vegetarians, and appreciate that there are a few selections for us (many pubs have just one, token veggie meal - but Stout has a few options which is great so that we don't get bored). The food we've had has been excellent, and the portions are substantial (sometimes we find it's better to just split a dish between the two of us instead of one each - unless we're particularly famished). \n\nOn one occasion, some friends were with us and one of the meals wasn't cooked fully (the only time in the 15 or 20 times we've been there) - but once the staff were alerted to it, they immediately apologized, took it back and created a new meal (I suspect that most places would have tried microwaving it, but in this case they created the meal from scratch again to ensure it was correctly done and handled it very professionally). \n\nThere are various areas of the pub and each are very inviting and comfortable (front room with fireplace/comfy seats/windows on to the street, the bar area, the back seating area and the patio). Sometimes the TV screens can be a bit distracting for me with sports channels playing all of the time (vs. for special events) but I think a lot of people prefer to have something like that in the background so I don't mind too much especially since the volume is turned off. \n\nI recommend Stout to friends and neighbours alike.

I feel like the guide should do a better job with earlier pick-ups to arrange seating better knowing he had our group towards the end of his pick up.

We were glad we followed Adam's advice to have lunch at  last stop because it had the best views. I liked that they provided unlimited water bottles since it was so hot.

I can't believe there are no railings and that people don't fall over!  I wonder why they have to charge so much for the Skywalk.  It's a neat experience, just not sure it's worth the extra money.

Oregano's  reached out to me and apologized for the terrible service and encouraged me to try the Mesa location once more.   \n\nI decided to try again  yesterday for dinner and what a difference.  People were friendly, engaging and overall our party was very happy with the service.  They seemed to really care that we chose to come into their restaurant.   I am changing my previous 2 stars to 5. It was really that much better!   Way to go! I am a fan again! \n\n\nBelow is my previous post \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is the 2nd time I have been to this location where the service was not good.    I know they can do better and the training is better than this, since I used to work for Oregano's.   \n\nThe first time was a month or so ago, but I chalked that up to the place just having a bad night.  I know they happen.  I went back again a few days ago with some friends but  the service was just the same; slow,  kinda rude, and un-attentive. \n\nThe experience started when we showed up with a 25 min wait on a Friday night (which i know is common), no big deal. We got some drinks at the bar, and sat in the waiting area.  Then I decided I would grab an appetizer for our group. I walked up to the hostess/togo counter to order and pay for it and the to-go girl started to ring me up with no problems. Awesome...right??  NO, the manager  (I know she was the manager, because she was wearing black) stopped her mid transaction and asked me to step to the other side of the counter to order with an actual server.  My thoughts.... OK fine, whatever. The problem was the tone and that she said \"no she can't help you, she has to help you over there\" and pointed to an actual server on the other side of the counter.  So I walked and had to wait until she was done putting in another order, after a  few min she was able to help me.  I get it, they are busy, but what was wrong with the to-go counter taking an order?  Especially since there was no wait and she was not on the phone.  That was off-putting.  I say this because I know better, I know Oregano's trains better than this. \n\nMoving on to dinner.  Since we already had drinks from the bar, I guess your server decided we didn't need any  refills the rest of the night, even after waiting 45 min to get our food.   We didn't order anything that takes a while (2 pasta dishes and a sausage sandwich), the kitchen was not slammed, since it was 9pm with several empty tables. Basically I had no drink for my dinner. We saw our server a total of 3 times.  Once to take our order, 50 min later to see how the food was, and last to drop the check. \n\nAs we were leaving the manager was giving a half-assed apology to another table for the abnormal amount of time things took, and honestly we were there MUCH longer than them. \n\nThe disappointing part is that I love Oregano's and I talk it up all the time. But this was a real let down.", "cool": 1, "date": "2012-08-21", "funny": 1, "review_id": "2cBtDiIY8kuuMBMpYaVTYA", "business_id": "VeBNqe1pI5QBxVbquv0uoQ", "stars": 5, "user_id": "nU7bqDWLUFePCFreKw931Q", "useful": 1}, {"text": "New client here, prospective anyway. Found this place through a deal coupon. My initial appointment was for 7PM, but I wanted to change it to 7:30. Later on that night I got a message that says, \"we'll just change your 7pm to 8:30...\". (So wrong! You don't contact the client and tell them when they can come in, you ASK if the new time works for them. Where's the courtesy?)  Anyway, I called back within about a minute and left a message to keep it at 7pm.  I then went to some lengths to rearrange my schedule to make it a half hour ahead of time as requested so I don't get charged $25. (Who does that for people that are late? No-show, sure. I do that at my practice, but just for being late? wtf?) Today just before I was about to leave for this location, I received a message that my appointment was cancelled due to a \"broken heater\". The message was left only ONE HOUR before my appointment time. That sounds suspicious.\n\nHere's the thing. The kind of work that I do is labor-intensive and I was really looking forward to a little escape. I was planning on making this a habit if it was as good as I had imagined. Yeah, sure I was really disappointed. And yeah, sure, it was nobody's fault -- if there actually was a malfunction that is, which I now seriously question. So after remaking the appointment I called them back and cancelled it. Got my money back from the deal coupon I was holding. Just a bad vibe.\n\nI guess what really irks me is the laissez-faire, \"don't-give-a-shlt\" voice at the other end.  I really don't think the person I spoke to cared about the upset he'd caused, certainly not enough to offer anything out-of-the-box to make sure this prospective client becomes a client. Just a certain tone I picked up on. (Clearly this wasn't the voice of experience talking. More like the voice of adolescence.) And yeah, sure, shlt happens. The heater broke down. Fine. Whatever. But to be scooted around like a schedule item rather than asking my permission as a person beforehand (1), and then to be cancelled an hour before my appointment without any other solution better than \"we'll have to reschedule you\" (2), was just void of creativity to say the least. In my business, if I needed to cancel someone unexpectedly, I would have added an extra half-hour to the next session, or at least offered some sort of a credit - something other than, \"we'll just have to reschedule you.\" Where's the incentive to come back? Do you want return clients or not? All I can say is business must be REALLY good. But wait a minute - you're running giveaways through a deal coupon vendor! Way to go...\n\nSo True REST Float Spa, please get this: THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION IS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. Give a (potential) customer the feeling that they're not really that important, even once, and you've lost them. You just lost me. Care much about that?.

Was given a two massage \"gift\" for my wife and I through Living Social. Called to make an appointment and the desk lady gave us the \"you can't use it for two people. Didn't you read the fine print?\" runaround. I contacted the person who gave us the coupon and they decided to give us another so we could both go, so I called back to schedule an appointment. They couldn't do it on a few days that we could because they were \"remodeling.\" I explained that my wife and I live overseas and only had a week and a half to get both massages. The desk lady promised me she would get us in twice before we leave, but refused to schedule the second ahead of time. She said they can't do that until the first appointment, but again PROMISED she would get us in both times before we leave... more on that later.\n\nWe arrived to the place in shambles and obviously in the middle of being remodeled (why were they even open?). Holes in the drywall being patched and scraped down, paint cans laying around, the whole nine yards. The lady at the desk had her back turned to us and barely looked up to greet us when we walked in. We filled out the paperwork and noticed right away that one if not two of the workers were obviously under the influence. Not a great first impression.\n\nBoth ladies who gave us the massage were friendly and the massage itself was good. Though it was a bit uncomfortable in the tiny room with the smell of alcohol and the cramped quarters. The room smelled like strong alcohol every time one of the ladies breathed. Not an ideal environment for a massage. I had asked when I made the reservation for my wife and I to be in the same room for the massage, so they stuffed us in a room the size of a walk in closet. The ladies could barely move around the tables and kept knocking things over throughout the 90 mins. Again, I want to stress, the massage was great, I just couldn't be more unimpressed with the overall experience. We got dressed and walked out to schedule the second time and SURPRISE... they were all booked up. I threw out all the dates and times that we could before we left the country to go back home, but all we're taken for \"paying customers and clients\" (does a coupon not count as a paying customer?). She passive aggressively suggested we should have come in sooner, even though I explained we weren't even in the same state. There were obviously huge gaps on the calendar open on her computer screen, but she assured me they were all booked until the day after we left. Convenient.\n\nThe desk lady then explained that I could just give the coupon to someone else (something she had already told me on the phone we could not do), so after being lied to the first time I asked her to write it on the coupons. She only wrote it on one and I had to ask her to wrote it on both. I'm pretty sure she will still try to argue about it with the poor souls who we may or may not give these coupon to.\n\nThe cherry on the cake was that after being lied to and offered no practical help to get us our second massage; I was chased out into the parking lot by the desk lady asking for a tip. I explained that I don't tip for the level of service and unprofessionalism we experienced (mostly her fault). Never done that in my life. She gave me a guilt trip about how the ladies were on commission and also passive aggressively indicated that I was unaware of the cultural norms in America. Ha! I'm pretty sure being drunk on the job is not up to cultural norms in America either. I explained that I would not tip for that kind of service and for being treated as a second class customer to their \"paying\" clients.\n\nThis is the first negative review I've ever posted on yelp and probably a waste of time. But I wrote it because the level of customer service from the desk lady WAS REALLY THAT BAD! I left asking the question, why offer a coupon on LivingSocial if you're going to treat those paying customers like garbage?

But what made the night worse was when I showed them my groupon through my app off my phone they refused to take it saying they needed a printed copy to put in the computer. I, being a server myself, and also having to have dealt with groupons couldn't understand why she wouldn't accept my groupon. So we had an argument for 5 minutes. Than my boyfriend asked for a manager and we were told no one was in other than the cashier. GREAT! The cashier calls the manager and comes back to tell me the most she can do is take 20 percent off my tab. Tab was 59.43 and through groupon I had paid 15 for 30 so I was infuriated to say the least. Even showing the damn groupon receipt and what it in tells that I am entitled to she still denied my 30 dollars off. So we told her we will not pay for anything on the tab because now we're being ripped off.

Las Vegas is famously known for its buffets. When I was in Vegas years ago, I remember the glorious Caesar's Palace buffet that my family and I ate at, so I was kind of excited to find out that we got a free buffet at the MGM Grand. Sadly, the only saving grace to this buffet was that it came with our hotel room. To any visitors looking for a buffet experience, I HIGHLY recommend that you avoid this place at all cost. I would recommend eating dropped table scraps from the MGM food court before eating at this place... yes it is that bad!\n\nThe service was pretty standard when it comes to service at any buffet. Waiter comes in and takes your drink order then you go to town on the food selection. I ended up eating some crab legs, and roast beef at my MGM buffet experience. The crab legs were very tasteless... almost like these legs were thawed from a frozen pack of pre-cooked crab legs that one can buy at their local super market. The texture of the legs was very dry and stringy. One would expect food of this quality at dormitory cafeteria buffet at any University on Tuesday nights, let alone, at Las Vegas. Not tasty at all. The roast beef was so-so. The slices were pretty small, and that beef itself was way overcooked, which lead to the meat being tough. It was a step above dormitory cafeteria food, but also a several steps below an average Golden Corral.\n\nThe desserts were better. Its like the typical desserts that you will find at any buffet, such as the self serve ice cream, premade cakes, cookies and such. But then you would expect desserts of this quality at a generic buffet, not at a Las Vegas resort and casino. If you are staying at the MGM Grand and received a free MGM buffet voucher, then by all means, eat the free food. If the only buffet experience that you have ever had was at your undergrad dorm cafeteria, a hospital buffet or at a friend's dumpster eating 3 week old Thanksgiving left overs, then this might be your place to eat, however you will get more bang for your buck at the McDonalds food court on the other side of the building.
