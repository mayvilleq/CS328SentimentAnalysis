Reason being, this isn't their first restaurant opening. Globe has two other locations, so it's owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant. But rather than focus on the facts that it smelled like a construction site, the floors and walls needed some minor finishing work, the staff were wandering about looking slightly confused and a little scared, and the place generally seemed like it probably wasn't ready to open just yet, I'm going to put all that aside and focus on the rest of Globe.\n\nGlobe's focus is on local stuff; that means they try to only serve products that are made close-to-home. Trouble is, I'm not exactly sure how far that close-to-home boundary extends to. I was told that it includes Ontario as a whole, but it could also go much further East or West; their Albacore tuna, for example, comes from BC and their mussels come from PEI. Other items don't explicitly explain where they come from, like the Cornish hen. That's the difficulty with going local though; right-off-the-bat you need to firmly establish your local boundaries. BC and PEI, after all, aren't right around the corner. Why not Maine lobster? Maine is a lot closer and seems a lot more local to me than anywhere in BC.\n\nI suppose my beef here is that if you want to focus on locally produced stuff, then why not do it right down to the last detail? Why have a couple of wines from Italy and the US when you could easily make a wine menu completely from Niagara Peninsula wines or even from West Coast British Columbia (since we haven't yet established where that local line is drawn). I suppose the entire local concept is pretty hot right now, considering the whole farm-to-table trend, but those places are a bit more sincere by growing and sourcing everything onsite. To me, that's what true local eating is all about: setting firm boundaries.\n\nThe main thing that caught me right away-even more so than the local-ness of stuff-was the truly reasonable prices. At my initial walk-in to the beautiful dining room, I expected to pay a bit more, but that wasn't the case at all. Starters are around 11 bucks, entrees are around 22; at prices like that, it's even kind of refreshing, considering how elegant both the dining room and bar spaces are. And the food is good too. The local carnivore flatbread, for example, had a perfectly cooked flatbread base with some delicious, good-quality meats. The baked Spring vegetable tart seemed a little strange served on raw spinach, but the contrast worked nicely together.\n\nThe dining room space is beautiful. 20 foot ceilings, elegant lighting, solid wooden tables. In terms of sheer ambience and sophistication, there's nothing in Bloor West Village that can even come close to competing with Globe.\n\nDespite the wandering servers, we were lucky enough to have the only one that seemed focused. Even though the meddling manager kept needlessly hovering over us mere seconds each time before our server got there, we had fantastic service that pretty much made the entire experience better. If we had another server, I probably would have thought a lot less.\n\nTruth be told, Globe's focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion. However despite that, it was a pretty good overall experience, opening jitters and stage fright aside. I think that once they work all the kinks out, there'll be nothing in Bloor West Village-an area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin with-that can even come close to competing with Globe.", "date": "2011-06-01", "cool": 1, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "business_id": "SmizR7MLt-558FJJQRBBoQ", "stars": 4}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "Vtd6Tqm7YMfRTBFLtZIoOQ", "text": "Alright, alright, so as it turns out I sometimes judge a book by its cover. Or, in this case, a bar by its' signage. Let's face it, I'm a sucker for good signage. And Souz Dal has it. The rusty globe hangs outside like a relic, the name of the bar cut into the side. Lit, and glowingfrom within, it reminds me of one of those tin punch-out crafts made from a (insert random legume) canat summer camp. But much cooler of course. It was this sign that caught my attention on more than one occasion, beckoning me in when I had somewhere else to be. Finally, one night a couple of weeks ago, I gave in to its sirens call. I was a little bit disappointed.\n\nIt was devoid of people save for us and the lonely bartender. I say lonely, butjudging by his charm (see: none) he probably liked it better thatway. Granted though, it was early - Souz Dal only has a drink menu - and a few more folk trickled in as the night wore on.\n\nThe stars I gave are attributed solelyto the bar's ambience. Dimly lit, and painted in muted reds and oranges it has an earthy orMoorish feel to it. Worn textiles and cathedral mirrors adorn the walls, while candles flicker on every table, casting shadows. The back patio has a similar vibe happening, cloistered in by high walls, andlit by candles wedged in the mouths of old wine bottles.\n\nNow I rarely turn down a good patio, but in this case I chose aseat inside, which says a lot.Reclined on velvet benches at our table by the open front window, we watched College Street come alive as we perused the drink menu. I was in a cocktail mood, and my friend had read somewhere that Souz Dal claimed to have the \"best\" mojitos in the city, so that was the first order I placed. \n\nNow I've been to Cuba. I did a little backpacking, starting in Havanaand makingmy way to the South coast. I wouldn't say I'm a connoiseur of the mojito because of this, but I diddrink my fair share, and like to think I know a thing or two about a good one. And this wasn't one of them. There wasn't nearly enough mint or sugar, so it was overwhelmingly bitter. I don't like my mojitos to taste like Kool-Aid, but I do like a little sweetness to curb the edge. \n\nUnlikely to order another of the same, but unwilling to give up on the bar, we tried a few other beverages. Nothing wowed us. The Moscow Mule with its ginger beer offered a nice slow burn, but it also wasn't a repeat offender. The fortune cookie garnish on the lychee-infused Soho martini was fun, but not nearly as tasty as a lychee would have been. \n\nAlthough funky signage and ambience mean a lot to me, a good drink means even more, so chancesare Iwon't be returning to Souz Dal. If however, you are in the market for an intimate date setting (see: empty bar) then head on over. And if a mediocre mojito is your thing, then you can get them herefor $5.75 on Mondays.", "date": "2011-08-20", "cool": 0, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "business_id": "qhJ4GDULYbdb_sctDgbZgw", "stars": 2}, {"useful": 3, "funny": 0, "review_id": "t98usw-bvob9JqMJPvvnsw", "text": "Uncle Betty's is a family foodie heaven: the sole Toronto provider of New York's famous Dreesen's doughnuts, a colourful ice cream and dessert bar, warm and fuzzy comfort food, and a small selection of beer and wine for the grown-ups in the crowd, all make this a popular place for parents and kids alike. Uncle Betty's has only been open for a few months, but it already seems to have garnered a dedicated following. We went to Uncle Betty's on a bustling Friday night, looking for a casual meal and easy going atmosphere; Uncle Betty's certainly provided both. Painted in bright blue and cheery orange, lots of seating inside, and a small patio off the front, we felt right at home. Several families were enjoying meals with their kids in tow As the evening wore on though, most of those families were replaced with twenty and thirty-somethings looking for a cool place to hang out.\n\nOffering sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, and many other of Uncle Betty's specialty creations, the menu is fairly extensive and varied. We ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich with a salad, and the grilled cheese sandwich, which was made with homemade mac-and-cheese and meatloaf stuffed inside. Their grilled cheese also comes in a pulled pork variety, which I am sure we will try on our next outing. Both meals were great, the vegetable sandwich was warm, the cheese was nicely melted, and the bread was crisp. The grilled cheeses sandwich was deemed as one of the \"best ever,\" however, the portion size was on the small side for a $15 sandwich. Both of us agreed that the sandwich could be a little bigger, but overall we were impressed with the quality and creative effort put into the food. \n\nFor dessert, we each tried a Dreesen's cinnamon sugar doughnut, made fresh on site, and although they were pretty tasty, I am setting my sights on the ice cream bar next time. It is far too bright and colourful to miss, with jars of candy toppings and a great selection of ice cream flavours to choose from.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, and we had a conversation with the owner, Samara Melanson, as we were leaving. Samara and her husband recently opened the restaurant, and it's always great to meet the owner while dining out and learn about the creation of the restaurant and where some of the ideas for the food come from. She told us that chef Paul Lampa was brought over from Coquine restaurant, which explains the \"gourmet\" comfort food bent and the locally sourced ingredients. \n\nMost appetizers are priced from 6 - 10 dollars; entrees varied in price from about 9 - 15 dollars, and wine and beer was in the 6 - 8 range. And Uncle Betty's carries Kicking Horse coffee, which is an instant sell and a welcome find for this Toronto-transplanted Western girl. \n\nBetty's also offers what looks to be a delicious weekend brunch, with homestyle blueberry pancake and Uncle Betty's own take on eggs benny, which comes served on a doughnut.

Every couple of years some new ingredient or dish seems to capture the attention of cooks everywhere. Someone does it well, and then soon niche restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere.\n\nA number of years ago, it was the burrito, soon the poutine became chic.\nLately it seems like everyone needs to prove they have the best Southern-style barbeque.\n\nOn a recent Saturday night, I had the opportunity to eat at Lou Dawg's; Southern Sandwiches at King and Portland in the Entertainment District. Nestled in the basement, Lou Dawg's seems to be punching above its weight. It has a fairly small front of house, and on this night, a third of that front of house seemed to be taken up by an impromptu stage while the sound and light guys were setting up. And once they did, it was loud! Not only that, it wasn't even music. The sound system was blaring an audio feed from the football game projected on the large screen on the opposite wall. Despite that, the place was buzzing. Pretty much all the tables were full and the young-ish crowd that was there seemed to be happy enough, with tables full of plates and pints.\n\nWith our large order placed at the bar, we watched a group clear out and quickly snagged the table. No sooner did he drop off our pints did our food arrive. It was super quick, and it couldn't have been more than five minutes. My guests and I ordered the gamut of the menu: pulled chicken, beef brisket, and pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad, coleslaw and a 'Loutine' (poutine with pulled pork). Everything looked great...\n\nThe pulled pork had a pleasant smoky flavour and was quite juicy and moist, but after a couple of bites it seemed to be very one note; there wasn't that nice tang you get with true southern barbeque. The pulled chicken was very dry. This is a dish most people have difficulty doing well, and I don't think Lou Dawg's is any different. It seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile... waiting for someone to order it... The beef brisket was popping with flavour. It was succulent, with just the right amount of fattiness. If you're there, I highly recommend it.\n\nSide dishes is where Lou Dawg's really shines. Their coleslaw is creamy, sweet and crisp, with dried cranberries and raisins. And the potato salad? Truly made with love. It burst with flavours of dill and mustard seed, and the potatoes were cooked to the perfect texture.\n\nThe small poutine was quite a large portion. The fries were as they should be: crisp and fresh tasting with a hefty salting. If the cheese was curds, you couldn't tell. They had lost all of their consistency from over heating. The chicken gravy was way too salty and overpowered the mild flavour on the pulled pork.\n\nOverall, Lou Dawg's didn't live up to the hype. I've had better Southern barbeque at places that don't specialize in it, and way better at places that do. Coupled with that, the restaurant seemed a little unsure of itself. Is it trying to be a restaurant? a sports bar? or a neighbourhood performance space? or just a hangout for friends of the staff? This indecision usually sounds the death knell of any place. So while the sides and brisket made it a place worth returning to, there wasn't much keeping me from going somewhere else.", "date": "2011-01-17", "cool": 1, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "business_id": "yTWSFoGjkK6pl7kJm8f0Dg", "stars": 2}, {"useful": 2, "funny": 1, "review_id": "070Mmij4jDIqLV-Cy5w7bw", "text": "So lately I've been on a bit of an Italian kick. Maybe its the changing of the seasons, and I'm subconsciously trying to carbo-load for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation. Whatever it is, this past Monday I was looking for just that at Terroni on Queen West.\n \nThe camp is divided on Terroni. People either rave about it or complain about the pretentious servers, the 'no-substitution' rule, or the slice-it-yourself pizza. Being a fan of this place, I have a rebuttal for each of these complaints. \n\nWhile (some of) the servers may seem a bit curt at first, I owe this to the fact that Terroni is busy - always busy - and their no-nonsense attitude is often mistaken for pretentiousness. Our server, although brusque, took our order diligently while complementing our choices, had our wine to the table in no time, and managed to pour two glasses of the stuff from the awkwardly shaped porcelain decanter without dribbling it everywhere (which is something we later failed to do). \n\nAs for the no-subsitutions rule, if you want to choose your own toppings, then head on down to that infamous sub-par pizza joint (you know the one...with its orange boxes and redundant title) and stuff your crust while you're at it. Since when did slicing pizza become a chore? Just a few simple back and forth motions with a knife and voila! Freshly sliced pizza.  \n  \nRegardless of the division, Terroni is always packed. Monday at 9:00 found us one free table upstairs, which was where our preference lay anyway. Although I do love to pull up to the bar, it tends to get a bit clustered on the lower level, and while the upstairs isn't exactly quiet, shouting across the table isn't required. \n\nOur waiter promptly brought us the menus and we poured over the apps and the twenty-nine - yes, twenty-nine - pizzas they have to offer.  \n\nWe started with the Funghi Assoluti ($12.95):  breaded and baked oyster mushrooms served on arugula, sprinkled with parmesan, and drizzled with a balsamic glaze.  It was superb, but sharing proved to be problematic, not because the portion wasn't large enough, but because we simply didn't want to. Social graces saved us, but I had visions of the two of us in an Animal Planet-esque showdown... circling the last mushroom with fangs bared and hackles raised. \n \nWe chased all of this down with a velvety Piemonte that was oddly served in a jug, which made it difficult to pour. Our server made it look effortless, but us? Well, we just made a mess. I did manage to solve the problem however (pour from the side, and not from the oddly shaped lip) and fortunately for us we had a seemingly bottomless half litre.\n \nNo sooner had we finished sharing the last 'shroom was our pizza delivered to the table. We went with the Primavera ($15.95) to contribute to our daily recommended dose of veggies and to somehow convince ourselves that we were being healthy. All of the pizza at Terroni is thin crust and ours was weighed down heavily with tomatoes, red pepper, (more) mushrooms, and artichokes with a few black olives decorating the centre of the pie. \n\nNow when I say thin-crust, I mean it.  Maybe I'm just speaking for myself here, but I have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at Terroni. I'm a big fan of folding slices before biting into them, and the crust at Terroni is so thin and pliable I always envision myself folding a whole pizza in half,...and then in half again...and then having my way with it.

Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's \"Eat Drink Man Woman\", and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.\n\nThree hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...\n\nMomofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC & Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.\n\nWith the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.\n\nAs you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.\n\nFirst we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!\n\nNext came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!\n\nWe then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and crudit\u00e9; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.\n\nAnd then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.\n\nLastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,\n\nWe decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.\n\nAll in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic.

It's a fun way to people watch, without really having to watch out for them, but it's also a great way to spot new businesses, or old ones for that matter.  The past couple of times I took this trip, I wondered what was in the chalkboard-black building on the corner of Queen and Elm Grove.  I assumed it was a gallery given it was such a big space, and I was half right.  The Mascot is a coffee shop that showcases art...or an art gallery that serves coffee, depending on what you're going for I guess.  I myself was going for the coffee.\n\nAt first the place is a bit daunting.  It's quite large, with a lot of negative space, and very limited seating.  There are two barstools at the counter, a few tables that can seat more than one, and a surprisingly comfy blue velvet couch in the front room, but patrons need to be ready to get creative if all of those are taken.  The back room, which houses the artwork offers up a couple Victorian chairs for those who feel like working on their posture, an old elementary school chair/desk combo, and a springy antique rocking horse (???).  I'm not quite sure if that last option is for display only, or for those who like their coffee with a little bouncy nostalgia, but I for one wasn't about to find out.  I used to have one of those horses, and I remember getting pinched by the damn springs on a regular basis.  Luckily for us, there was a free table.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered a latte while I went with just a basic drip to see what Reunion Island coffee is like in its most vulnerable state.  I should've went with the latte.  Not that the drip was bad, but the latte was fantastic. It was smooth and strong without being bitter. The Rosetta adorning the foam was a nice touch as well.  (It should be noted that I went back a few days later for my very own).  \n\nAs it was around the brunch hour, and breakfast had long worn off we decided to get a couple of treats to go with our coffee.  The edible portion of the menu at The Mascot is provided by OMG Baked Goods, and like the seating, selection is limited.  The cupcakes were tempting but we were in the mood for savoury, so we ordered a ham & cheese quiche along with a stuffed foccacia.\n\nThe quiche arrived looking a little bit sad and we faced off as to who would try it first.  We both agreed that it was tastier than we would have guessed, but I've definitely had better quiche.  The stuffed foccacia on the other hand was a nice surprise.  It didn't come to the table looking like much... really just a bun on a plate.  But as with all things stuffed, it's what's inside that counts.  Filled with roasted peppers, artichokes and Asiago cheese, it was not unlike a grown-up Hot Pocket...one that got tired of all the negative attention so it moved out of its parents freezer, and adopted a healthier lifestyle.  The quiche was pushed aside, but later finished - out of hunger alone. \n\nFood however is an afterthought at The Mascot.  From what I saw, the people of Parkdale go for the coffee, and rightly so.  There was a steady stream of people coming and going, and judging by the interactions, quite a few regulars.  With friendly laid-back staff, good ambience and amazing lattes, I would make it my local too - if only I lived anywhere near it.\n\nFootnote:  Seating doubles in the warmer months, when it's comfortable enough to sit on the driftwood looking bench that runs the length of their storefront.  Another good place to do some people watching.", "date": "2012-01-28", "cool": 1, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "business_id": "sscP36MO34i5ep4QO8c7KA", "stars": 3}, {"useful": 1, "funny": 0, "review_id": "NksQNx6WYTR2x2vfo2BYTw", "text": "Relatively new to the King West theatre district, and across the street from the Bell Lightbox is, Paese.  New to the neighbourhood, but not new to the restaurant scene, Paese has been operating out of their Bathurst street location since 1989.  Serving up Italian comfort food in a casual but sleek atmosphere, Paese might give longtime district resident Kit Kat some competition.\n\nWith a monochromatic colour scheme, butcher block tables and exposed brick, Paese is very welcoming, even for someone who happened to be dining alone (see: yours truly).\n\nMy server brought the customary bread to the table...but this was no ordinary bread and oil. The bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour.  It came with an olive, rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty.  I tried to stop after one slice, but failed miserably.  I managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't staring at it longingly throughout dinner.\n\nNext, came my Beet Caprese Salad ($13).  Grilled beets came topped with a generous portion of mozzarella di bufala, drizzled with pistachio pesto and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.  The combination of flavours and textures worked well together, and it was just a very fresh salad overall. If seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring.  It was filling enough to be my main course, but I wasn't done yet.\n\nAs full of bread and beets as I was, I couldn't wait for my cavatelli ($13).  Hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasn't as filling.  The sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers, and that's a compliment as although she wasn't Italian, she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the years.\n\nI had initially sent away the wine menu, although I'm not sure why exactly.  Maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and I had another review to do...but those are hardly excuses not to partake.  It's part of the job after all.  Either way, one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table.  Smart man.\n\nPaese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle, they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass.  Now I'm no expert on wine, but I do drink a lot of the stuff so I know what I like, and I like Amarone.  I was given a sample of a 2004 Fumanelli Amarone before committing to a full glass, after which I gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up.  Rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as I'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...\n\nBecause of its location, I probably won't make a repeat visit but I don't think Paese is having a hard time attracting other customers.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show.", "date": "2012-02-29", "cool": 0, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "business_id": "6frPvwX14wDH8jju64ewRg", "stars": 3}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "htV6dNmUqaXwCIRt7vfO5A", "text": "It great fast food and get large portions.

Our struggle was on walks and going anywhere. Pepper is an incredibly protective pup, and any dog or cat we saw, from any distance, would evoke jumping and barking which was incredibly impactful on our lifestyle.

(I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple. \n\nMy friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.\n\nI am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar. It was overall bland, I tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it; they turned out to be peanuts, which I don't love to begin with, but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what you're eating, you know that it's not very flavorful. The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING.

I was never given an explanation as to what a root canal was or that I'd need to pay for crowns separately. So, I got the roots taken care of but due to insufficient funds (because I'm 18!) I couldn't afford crowns to keep them secure. \n\nFrom 19-21, I hopped from local dentists to dental schools, and even Mexico to save money on the treatments (crowns, bone grafts). I couldn't pull through with most places because they were discomforting and too business-like. \n\nFinally I found this place on yelp and after the consultation with Dr. Walker, I knew I could trust his work. He thoroughly went over my teeth, proposed a treatment plan, and even broke it down into separate operations to help lessen the financial stress. Most dental places feel fancy and the work they suggest never seems necessary (like they just want my money), but here, I understood the importance of each extraction and surgery because Dr. Walker took the time to explain things. \n\nIn the past few months we extracted a tooth, did a bone graft, and a root canal retreatment. All were extremely terrifying at first, but I trusted him. Everything went smoothly and even when the retreatment got complicated Dr. Walker comforted me by staying positive and updating me throughout the procedure.

I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. \n After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. \nMost sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10\" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4\"x6\". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews.

I've had their italian sausage sandwich (decent), the philly cheese sandwich (pretty good), pastrami (pretty good) and their chef salad. The chef salad is quite decent but they put these onions on it that look like they were meant to be battered and deep fried for onion rings. They were so large and overpowering that I started requesting to leave them off of the salad. Overall, the food has been decent, but this last time, I decided to get a small order of chili cheese fries. My God, that was a mistake. The chili was obviously out of a can...easily mistaken for dog food (even the smell took me for a loop). The cheese was like cheez-wiz....not appetizing at all. And like many reviewers stated, the fries were soggy. The fries are ALWAYS soggy. They don't punch a hole in the containers to let the steam out so once they're delivered, they are too far gone. \n\nAs for the delivery time, that's absolutely crazy too. For being in a fairly close proximity to their establishment, they sure take a LONG time, even if it's just an order of salads for myself and my co-workers. The delivery guy is different every single time and they are often a bit rude. \n\nMy co-worker ordered the chef salad yesterday, but was told they increased the price by almost $2.00. We unanimously agreed that we'll find some place new to get lunch. \n\nThe only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because I can't lie and say they don't have good food, they do. But when you wait well over an hour for your food, you hope it at least tastes good, and when something as easy as chili cheese fries is as egregiously bad as it was yesterday, it's hard to want to eat there again.", "date": "2015-04-07", "cool": 0, "user_id": "HtxS3TMKjzlCQINL9FAgzg", "business_id": "QMPDsRxHmDtap9ECO1Uwjg", "stars": 2}, {"useful": 1, "funny": 0, "review_id": "4do95uO6Xi9Z9l5kHrDUSw", "text": "Awful customer service.

My grandfather is a 93 year old man that can't hear well and can't speak all that clearly. The server misunderstood what he ordered and when utensils were brought out for the food, it was clear there had been a mistake. Instead of apologizing for it, the server got defensive and said that she had repeated the order and no one corrected it. She went back to the kitchen and corrected it, then came out and asked him if he was ok with that. He said of course, because it's what he ordered and she said yes, you better be ok with that. She started off quite friendly, and she ended quite friendly, but this caused some tension. \n\nMy other complaint would be the amount of time it took. From sitting down to being served food it was 45 minutes. Similarly, from ordering desserts to getting them it was about another 15 minutes. I can't comment on how busy the restaurant was because we weren't inside but this still felt lengthy to me. \n\nNot sure if we'll be back.

At first when you walk in, you do notice the equipment is outdated.  But the main trainer is one of the best I've experienced.  I felt it was ideal for beginners and those who have experience training.  \n\nEvery boot camp class was different and I attended 3 a week. Different music was played each class, so it was never the same.  Each boot camp class had different exercises so I was never bored.  We worked on every aspect of exercise, core, cardio, weight training, stretching, etc.  The teacher did go back and forth from English and Spanish which I thought was considerate since both Spanish and English speaking people were attending the class.  \n\nOne of the things I noticed was since I had bought a groupon, the trainers at the gyms I attended are notified you're a groupon buyer, almost like a label, and didn't show as much attention to me as they did to others.  As a groupon buyer you're not paying full price so it can show from the place you're at they won't give you full service.  At this gym this wasn't the case.  On two different occasions I was the only one who showed up for the boot camp class and instead of him cancelling he provided 1 on 1 personal training.  He was basically working for free but trained me like a full paying customer.  \n\nBottom line he's an excellent trainer who knows his stuff and cares about everyone that walks in the door.  The gym may not be the biggest or the newest but that's nothing in comparison to receiving quality training.

The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.\n\nI am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.\n\nCOBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!\n\nNow the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex\n\nI first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.\n\nI then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.\n\nI then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.\n\nWhen I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.\n\nFinally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.\n\nI went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.\n\nThe next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. \n\nI knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.\n\nI suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.\n\nAs a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.\n\nI went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. \n\nThey reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.\n\nJared to the rescue:\n\nI took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.\n\nLesson: NEVER GO TO THE 7700 LOCATION! ALWAYS GO TO THE 616 LOCATION!\n\nCOBBLESTONE, BAD MANAGERS MAKE FOR A BAD STAFF.

A great barbecue joint beside a Mr. Sub and Funky Thai 2 Go? In Oakville? Hmm.\n\nBrightly lit and very clean, the interior looked newly renovated and ready for some hungry paddlers. We grabbed a table and were promptly given menus, which we scoured for the meatiest, tastiest sounding dishes. Paddling 20km during a 3 hour torrential downpour makes you hungry.\n\nSweet Smoke is both family-friendly and a good hang out, and the owner and the waitresses provided great service. After dinner, the owner was quite chatty and talked about how he slow cooked his pork and what he thought of his competition. It was a very relaxed atmosphere for a casual Saturday night dinner. They also serve homemade iced tea - sweetened, brewed tea which I found better than the bottled variety. \n\nGrilled Portobello Mushroom Melt\nArugula, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Grilled Red Onions, Gruy\u00e8re Cheese, Guajillo Aioli on Toasted Rosemary Focaccia\nA generous helping of portobello paired extremely well with the gruy\u00e8re. This is the same cheese that Biff's used for their crepes, and I must say that I am a fan! Although I'm not usually a fan of cheesy sandwiches, gruy\u00e8re pairs very well with meat and vegetables, this sandwich being no exception. I especially enjoyed the toasted focaccia bread. Warm, \"meaty\" with mushrooms, and toasty - this was my second favourite sandwich!\n\nSouthwestern Club\nHickory Smoked Turkey, Crispy Pancetta, Tomato, Greens, Avocado and Chipotle Mayonnaise on Ciabatta\nWe were surprised to receive this sandwich, because we only inquired about it but didn't actually order it (whoops). It didn't matter - we were so hungry that it was a welcome appearance so there was no need to complain or send it back. The smoked turkey was nice and juicy, the ciabatta was was buttered and grilled. I would have liked a bit more pancetta for additional flavour. Decent sandwich, but the mushroom melt definitely eclipsed this sandwich. Even though it was my least favourite sandwich of the night, it was still tasty!\n\nEl Cubano \nPulled Pork, Shaved Smoked Turkey, Manchego Cheese and Quick Pickles on Sesame Seed Bun\nY-U-M! This was the best sandwich of the night. Smokey turkey, tender pulled pork, tangy sauce, and pickles was a great combination. Although it would probably be considered \"nontraditional\" for a pulled pork sandwich, I would have preferred it with the rosemary focaccia bread from the portobello mushroom melt and melted cheese. I liked the quick pickles quite a bit, I wouldn't mind ordering a side of them the next time I go in. The toasted sesame seed bun was soft & good, but wish it was a little more toasted - but the combination of the pulled pork and the turkey was heavenly so no complaints! Sammy win!\n\nFlat Iron Steak Burrito \nDrunken Beans, Queso Fresco, Ancho Chile Salsa and Cilantro\nUnable to find a great steak burrito in Toronto (tried Burrito Boyz, Burro Burrito, Big Fat Burrito and Burrito Loco) I felt like I was taking a chance ordering this. It came tender, juicy, and oh-so-delicious with melted cheese and great salsa. It was a good simple burrito, the meat was very well cooked - I wish it was jammed a bit more with veggies but considering that I wasn't at a burrito joint I can't expect to get a fat burrito. I wish there was a fast food burrito as tender as this...\n\nMixed Barbecue Sampler\nHickory Smoked BBQ Ribs, Slow Smoked Pulled Pork, Cowboy Beans, and Jicama slaw\nI came for the pulled pork, but when I spotted an item that gave you pulled pork and ribs, I was sold! The pulled pork was great - tender, juicy, smokey, and full of flavour. Everything I look for in pulled pork. While some might be turned off by the orange-coloured sauce, I happened to love the citrus flavour. If I could tweak one little thing, it would be the hickory flavour - more please!\nThe ribs however, were a little on the dry side but they still had a nice smokey flavour that I enjoyed. They weren't too dry, but I've had better.\nThe beans were tasty and saucy but the slaw was just slaw - I later learned that many people top their sandwiches with the slaw. I would've tried it if it occurred to me!\n\nCake and Shake!\nBlackout Cake with Dark Chocolate Pudding, and Vanilla Bean Milkshake\nThe chocolate fiend in me was definitely satisfied with this rich, moist cake.

Store # 6422, Fashion Square Mall, Scottsdale, Arizona.Tonight was the worst experience ever there!  I am a regular Zara Customer having shopped in Chicago, California, and Arizona locations for 8 years now.  This evening, I was shopping in the store for a total of 20 minutes from start to finish.  From the moment I walked trough the door this evening, not one sales associate said a word to me.  No one helped us!  My daughter and I made quick selections for her to try on because we needed something specific, and she headed towards the dressing room.  It was 8:57 at that moment, when the cashier, Maria Marte, was the first person in the entire time I was there to say anything to me.  Here is what she said, \"We are closed.\"  I replied, \"Its 3 minutes to closing, you aren't closed yet, my daughter wants to try 3 blouses on, and then we should be able to make a purchase quickly.\"  The cashier at Zara, Fashion Square replied to me, \"Well I'm closing my register.\"  \n\nAt 9:02 pm, the cashier Maria Marte turned to me and said, \"I'm closing my register.\".  I said in return, \"We are going to make a purchase, my daughter is finishing up in the dressing room.\"  Where in she stated, \"Well we are closed.\"  I said, \"You won't let us make a purchase?\"  Maria the cashier then said, \"Well my manager said to go ahead and close my register.\"  I asked to speak to the store manager, because this didn't seem right. It was no way to treat a customer who is trying to make a purchase at 2 minutes after 9:00 pm\n\nAt that moment, the assistant store manager came over to us.  His name is Ruben Sanchez.  Ruben turned to me and said, \"We are closed.\"  I said, I realize this, but we are about to make a purchase.  He then said, \"Well our registers are closing.\"  I looked at my watch and said, \"It's 4 minutes after, won't you give us some grace and let us make a purchase?\"  Ruben the assistant store manager at the Scottsdale, AZ store turned to the cashier and said, \"Close it down.\"  Then walked away from me.  I said to Maria the Cashier, \"I come 9 years out of Retail Sales, and have worked for Nordstrom and Barney's New York.  This is never an attitude that a sales associate should have towards a customer that would like to make a purchase.  Generally, at 9:00 pm closing you close the front door, but let any customers still in the store at that time finish out their transaction, make the purchase, then allow them to leave.  This is within a reasonable amount of time, it's 9:06 now.\"  Maria the cashier then said, \"Well my manager told me to close the register.\"  I replied, \"Even if that means you won't allow me to make a purchase.\"  She said, \"Yes.\"  After begging them to take my money, I finalized my transaction at 9;06 pm, with purchasing a white blouse my daughter had selected.  I don't think I could ever shop at the Zara Scottsdale, Arizona ever again.

I've seen them get two long lines of cars through in no time, but not this time. While I was waiting in the line of cars, I suddenly heard yelling. Apparently two young employees were arguing by the open door between the ordering speaker and the window. I got to listen to that go unchecked for awhile in the slow moving line.

There was one young lady who was trying to get everyone to work, but she was being ignored. Finally, the one person doing any work got our order together and took my money and gave me my food.

The fresh meat is nicely formed into balls up, as each serving awaits it's transformation. I chat with some other patrons, it must be my good looks, because others are asking me what this is and what that is. I reply quickly, I am a Burger Priest virgin. I order a double-double for my significant other and 'The Priest\" for myself. Somehow this seems wrong, given my strict catholic upbringing and years as an alter boy. Then my world is shattered. The mushroom fryer is broken. OH THE HUMANITY. So I opt for the double-double and an order of fries. I go for tomatoe, onion and mayo. Let the burger sing it's own song people. It's juicy, the meat flavour is there. Nice crisp on the patty and a minimal bun. It's good, but where are the angels, the path to the white light? Still waiting. Could you and I make these burgers at home? Of course. Is this the holy trinity of meat, bun and add ons, as others have stated? Not in my opnion, or at least not yet. Are they good, absolutely.

I declare that as the next frontier to conquer...\n\nI had read on some Charlotte email newsletters that Oku sushi was great and had won some kind of Charlotte sushi award, but I don't think you can compare Rusan's to Oku. Sure, they both serve the same thing, but the indoor ambiance really makes a difference on the dining experience. Oku sushi is more of a hipster sushi place that you'd go on a first date on, and dress up a little more to, while Rusan's really focuses on value of their sushi while exuding classic characteristics of Asian restaurant by having sticky tables and crumbs on booth seats. I wouldn't be scared to come here donned in athleisure-wear and tennis shoes. But hey, I like where their priorities are at (sushi crafting). I guess since I mentioned it with Oku, I have to say by no means would I not take someone on a first date to Rusan's- if I knew anyone who shares the same passion for fish as I do, this would be my go-to date night restaurant. It's not hipster, but it's definitely not trashy. Your chopsticks might be disposable, but the flavor variety and sushi-eating experience is everlasting.\n\n For $10, you can get anywhere from 2-4 rolls at Rusan's, while you barely can get an appetizer at Oku. Service is fast, and their fried iced cream dessert is absolutely delicious. They have so many rolls to try, so it will be awhile before I get tired of coming here. With two medium sized adult asian females, we downed five rolls and a fried iced cream and the bill came out to be $20 each.\n\n I'd take a huge group of friends here, or just eat and catch up with one friend.

We were even in his office right before they were closing and he didn't shoo us out the door.  We ended up taking the quote home and sitting on it for a month.  When we finally came back, John was eager to help us redesign something that we could be proud of.  And we did!!\n\nWhen our project kicked off, our project manager, David, and John met with us at home and walked us through the entire process.  They even had this cool little website where we could track dates and milestones.  Once it got started, it went very quickly!  Our only delays were because of the holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.. and the rain.. oh the rain).  And of course, I had soooo many questions.  David was always very responsive and easy to contact.  \n\nAt the end of our project, we scheduled an appointment with Jason and he walked us through the phone app to control our pool (yep, there's an app for that) and all the controls on our pool system.

I was ready to order right away and as I was talking to her she turned and walked away. I sat and waited as other patrons came in and sat down. The owner tended to them and the same waitress brought them their drinks and began to take their orders. I kept on waiting patiently for her to stop by but she proceeded to clear empty tables as well as ask other tables about their meals and if they needed anything.

The California King Crab roll was small for the price, though the flavor was apparently good.\n\nThere was a wait at the door for a few minutes while they prepared a table, but when we were shown to the cramped booth, there were several empty and clean booths on the way, why the wait?\n\nOur waiter was also a bit awkward, bringing entr\u00e9es out over a five minute span instead of at the same time.", "date": "2011-06-02", "cool": 1, "user_id": "NaORI-qPPhej_Ce_sRH2Iw", "business_id": "uOWWk2duBzNao8fiQFWkJQ", "stars": 2}, {"useful": 3, "funny": 0, "review_id": "3bKvxeQx9r5f7znEjyBD2w", "text": "Last night my wife and I enjoyed a nine-course tasting menu, and I had the best crab cake, salad, salmon, steak, and cheesecake I've ever eaten - all in one meal.\n\nOur meal started with a crab-cake and a small crab salad (with dill, apple, and celery). The crab cake was so warm and fell apart beautifully, perfect spicing, a little n'orleans remoulade underneath, and the lump crab was so sweet and tender. The salad was rich and creamy, a few bites of decadence.\n\nWe then had an artichoke bisque, which was unfortunately the low point of the meal for both of us as neither of us loves artichoke much. The base of the soup was fantastic, but the tough bits of artichoke were just okay, and the cracked pepper garnishing the dish was very coarse ground (which provided contrast to the consistency of the soup, but seemed out of place).\n\nThen on to a baby wedge salad, mine with blue cheese and buttermilk, Barb's with a housemade vinaigrette. The salad was composed with perfect bacon, dried bing cherries, spiced pecans, the blue was fragrant without being overwhelming. Barb's vinaigrette had so much body and cling, with such great balance that she couldn't stop making pleasant-eating-noises - you know the ones.\n\nWe had a little sorbet (blackberry, such concentration of fruit flavor), and then the three main courses.\n\nThe salmon was served with wilted spinach and a potato hash, but the salmon itself was cooked to a perfect and consistent temperature throughout without overcooking the edges, or a slightly-underdone-center. It had a gently spiced rock-hard crust on one side, with perfectly cooked salmon immediately below. The plate was served with a smooth and tangy lemon beurre blanc. Best salmon I've ever had.\n\nNext was the duck course, our server Johnathan mentioned reminded him of Christmas. Beautiful rare duck breast, served on a bed of whipped sweet potatoes (perfectly smooth, none of that stringyness you sometimes get with sweet potatoes) that had been flavored with vanilla and brown sugar. Not overly sweet but absolutely decadent, and a small serving of sauteed brussel sprouts. The richness of the duck offset the cabbagyness of the sprouts, and the sweetness of the potatoes was a great offset to that pair. On top was a single sage leaf - the most fragrant I've ever smelled - which tied it all together and made it feel like christmas.\n\nThe third entree was the filet mignon, what Barb would have chosen, had we only had one choice of entree. Served rare to mid-rare, it had the same amazing cookery as the salmon, where the temperature and doneness was consistent throughout to almost within a millimeter of the soft crust. Served with a green peppercorn sauce, by far my favorite sauce of the night, which had spiciness and richness. The mashed potatoes served with the filet were nothing much on their own, but served as a perfect vehicle for the sauce, and the braised collards were noteworthy for both their balanced flavor as well as the fact that they were perfectly cooked. The greens had little snap in the backbone, they weren't wilted as so many collards become. They were barb's first bite off the plate, and made her eyes light up and she was almost rushing me to try a bite. The steak itself was pure silk on a plate. Warm, lucious, flavorful (uncommon for a filet!). Unfortunately, I do think that Barb's half of the filet was slightly more cooked, and came out mid-rare/medium, but mine was perfect.\n\nNext, a small goat-cheese log stuffed with dried fruit, rolled in crushed nuts, and served with two pieces of baguette. The baguette had a wonderful quality of being crisp and light (like melba toast, but not as dry), without having a crust that was so hard as to be painful to the gums (as so many toasted baguettes do). Also on the plate were a few tiny slices of celery, and a small drop of wildflower honey. This is not your store-bought-in-a-bear-squeezy honey, but rather it was fragrant and flavourful, very sweet, and brought out a dessertlike quality to the cheese/nut/fruit/bread combination. Barb, I'm sure, would go to great lengths to find that honey again, she enjoyed it so much.\n\nLastly, the cheesecake course. When it arrived, it was small, and we both looked at eachother and said \"this is how cheesecake should be served\", not a huge slab that's a chore to work through, but a small indulgence at the end of the meal. It was rich, but fluffy, and so moist. None of that powdery or clumpy feel that you get at a factory. Served with a bourbon-vanilla-cream sauce on the plate. The sauce was sweet, complex, but not cloying. The cheesecake was sweet and rich, and I mopped that plate clean. But the whole course was never too much of anything, it was just a perfectly walked tight-rope, never too sweet or too rich, never too moist or too dry, but everything was executed wonderfully.", "date": "2014-04-04", "cool": 0, "user_id": "NaORI-qPPhej_Ce_sRH2Iw", "business_id": "yIBeZebnXb-hvexqknnDCg", "stars": 5}, {"useful": 1, "funny": 0, "review_id": "vURAQqDU50fj9HM8L88wjQ", "text": "Genova pizza is amazing.

In fact, most people may feel like its still neglected, but looking around, it's evident that there are signs of improvement. That's where Three Speed comes in. Located unseemingly near Pauline on Bloor street West, they definitely took a risk opening up in this somewhat seedy Toronto neighbourhood. But regardless the risk, it seems to have worked for them. Packed nightly with 20-something hipsters, it's difficult to get a seat if you show up past 8 or 9 o'clock, but don't let any of that stop you. As far as 'Blansdowne' goes, bar-wise there just isn't much that competes with it. \n\nThree Speed is brought about by the same people that started the Communist's Daughter, and they also have some affiliation with The Dakota, so you can expect the same sorta crowd and atmosphere--and dare I say pretentiousness--that you'd expect to see in any of those spots. If you can find the dam place that is...\n\nThree Speed is difficult to notice. In fact, if you weren't directly looking for it or didn't know where it was, you'd probably go right past; and if it wasn't for the red lights strung about the front window spiking my curiousity, I probably wouldn't have ever discovered it either. So when you're walking around Bloor and Lansdowne, and you finally do find it and get inside, the hidden-factor sorta gives the feel of a Bloordale oasis.\n\nThe inside of Three Speed is not what you'd expect by the near-crumbling exterior. Inside it's dimly lit, low-key, and seriously comfortable. With exposed brick, wood panels, and art galore, it's an easy place to want to hang out at.\n\nScribbled on a chalkboard and suspended on the bar wall, Three Speed has a slightly random food menu that displays their feature items, like mussels served in 1 of 3 styles,  Lo, Med, and High, indicating 'speed' but not content. You can expect well-rounded flavours of lime, fennel, and roasted garlic. No mistake, these are mighty good mussels.  But if there's a bunch of you, and mollusks aren't your thing, I'd recommend the Party Plate. It's a nice spread of cheese, meat, and pickled goodness. If you're not the sharing type, I'd go with the sirloin burger. Although I've definitely had better, this is still a savoury and sizeable burger that won't disappoint you.\n\nLike I said, it feels like the neighbourhood is on the mend and slowly losing its feel of neglect. There are even a few other cool spots that followed suit and opened up in this neighbourhood, like Holy Oak and the Starving Artist; both businesses that are beginning to do well.\n\nIf you're in the Bloordale area, hanging out at Three Speed is an easy, but slowly becoming not the only option. But the fact remains, these people have taken a crappy, ex-Karaoke dump in a less-than-desirable neighbourhood and turned it into something special that is directly impacting the culture of Bloordale and for that, they definitely deserve to be commended. Nice job Three Speed.", "date": "2010-12-03", "cool": 3, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "business_id": "WlkOFaqRL5vtYZZ7fl4x1Q", "stars": 4}, {"useful": 3, "funny": 1, "review_id": "jATJA_ZFrHZBtlgRphW_gg", "text": "Playa Cabana Cantina is the latest restaurant to open in Toronto to fuel our newfound taco addiction in the city. It's located in The Junction at 2883 Dundas St. West (at Keele).\n\nPlaya Cabana Cantina is the second location for Playa Cabana - with it's first location on Dupont (at Davenport). The Junction has accepted it well, considering there were absolutely no reservations available for the whole weekend - but they assured me that they keep the bar open for walk ins.\n\nSo we walked in. Right away I was impressed by the decor, there's plenty of neon-lit signs including a shout out to JUNCTION - WEST TORONTO, and an \"Keep and Enforce Prohibition\" sign at the bar - perhaps a little tongue in cheek reference to The Junction's past as a dry neighbourhood until 2000.\n\nThe menu here is set up a little differently than other taco favourites like Grand Electric or La Carnita. Instead of ordering tapas style - one taco at a time, Playa Cantina's menu includes everything from tacos and tostados to burritos and enchiladas along with a side of rice and black or pinto beans.\n\nWe started off the meal with guacamole and chips. The chips arrived warm to the table and were extra crispy and fresh. The guacamole was smooth and not too spicy for our tastes. The bartender replenished the chips free of charge too, which is a great touch.\n\nPlaya Cabana Cantina has a fresh oyster bar set up, and at $2 a shuck, we couldn't resist them. They were huge, no skimping here, and were served with horseradish and hot sauce. Then, we each ordered a set of tacos with a side of rice and black beans, after starting off with Amber Agave Margaritas.\n\nThe Ancho Braised Shortrib-Brisket Crispy Tacos were served on a corn tortilla with melted cheese, sour cream and pico de gallo. They came to the table piping hot, and the mix of brisket and cheese was perfect along with the extra crispy tortilla. They were reasonably priced at $14 for an entree.\n\nNext up was the Tacos de Pescado (Baja-Style fish tacos) for $13 . They were a little underwhelming in comparison. The breaded tilapia didn't have the substance to stand up to the guacamole and shredded cabbage filling. Usually I'm a big fan of a good fish taco but this wasn't the best I've had lately.\n\nPersonally, I prefer picking and choosing different tacos to try instead of ordering them as a personal entree. The sides of yellow rice and beans were fresh and a great addition, but it would have been great to try a few different kinds of tacos instead of three of one kind.\n\nWith another round of drinks coming, we felt the need for some dessert... Unsure of what to get, the bartender recommended the Mexican Flan, so we gave it a shot. After waiting a little longer than necessary (I think the kitchen forgot about us), our bartender arrived with the flan, which was actually 2 mini flan served with whipped cream. He apologized for the delay and said the dessert was on the house.\nOverall the personal service at the bar was great, the bartender gave us a lot of recommendations on what to order and was more than helpful. The atmosphere was comfortable and casual, it didn't have that 'too cool' vibe that many new restaurants are picking up on now.\n\nWe definitely will be returning to try out the burritos and other menu items along with the amazing guacamole again too. The tacos were flavourful, with fresh, house made ingredients but not the best of what the city has to offer right now.", "date": "2013-04-01", "cool": 3, "user_id": "YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA", "business_id": "fK1oj0dk9Bc6KsBk5mMDxg", "stars": 4}, {"useful": 3, "funny": 0, "review_id": "ynF-WD-11AcpNAcoroOpjw", "text": "Excellent location, close to Kensington Market. \n\nIt's definitely a favourite spot for a pint or two when in the area.

The woman who did it just said not to be rough with them, to not use mascara, and to use oil free remover.\n\nI wanted eyelash extensions again for a trip I was taking on a Friday. The Sunday before my trip, I went to this location for a petite set. I was given a packet of materials, and part of it said to get your lashes done at least a few days before an event. Lucky me, I thought, because I was going about 4 days before leaving. I figured my lashes would last for at least a few weeks and then I'd have to get a touch up to just fill in empty spots. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nFirst of all, the woman who worked on my eyes must not have washed her hands. I could smell a strong peanut butter smell, and those little latex finger things they use didn't help. \n\nSecond, my lashes lasted for less than a week and a half, despite me following their instructions to the letter. I didn't wear any eye makeup for several days before, I didn't wash my eyes the day I got them and for a couple of days after, and I barely wore any eye makeup at all and definitely did not use mascara. When I did wear eye makeup, I used makeup remover that was oil free and meant for lash extensions. I was on vacation but didn't swim or submerge my head. When I took a shower, I kept my face out of the water at all times. Even with me being extremely careful, every time I blinked another lash would fall off. By the end of the week they were 90% gone.\n\nI was extremely disappointed with the lashes. I am also pretty suspicious of the fact that they push you to get an annual membership so you can get a refill once month. \n\nAnyway, I'm glad I got a Groupon for this because I would have been even more mad if I had paid full price ($250).

Rob speaks of not knowing what he's getting in too in some people's vehicles(his words) I agree. He did make a complement of the rear DVD player and how good of quality it was before it broke tho. He claims he tested it after he broke it?. Lol. I had to buy a new one as the ribbon was ripped out and  unfixable.   As for the dash left loose on the friday....... Nicki robs wife and the installer odie who did the work sure were surprised when I went back in to tell them about it.... No mention of that.  My new installer said 3 out of 4 clips were missing no big deal. Why would you ever leave someone dash loose for a weekend ? Either stupid or lazy falls into this category.  But moving forward. Again not his fault, but it's His NOT GIVE A Sh@t attitude is what bugged me the Most. I understand things happen I'm a contractor,  things happen and it sucks when they do. but his (I'm the boss of this place and I don't care attitude)  should keep everyone away from there. I'm not unreasonable, bad things happen. I would have bought one hopefully at cost or something but no.  So that's the loose dash and broke rear DVD player covered. \nOn to the remote starter....... My new guy said the remote start was wired backwards or something (positive/negative something or other) and that's probably why it wouldn't start with a key and when he took out the old remote start he wired it to something wrong and crossed something a rookie mistake as he put it. As for the marker lights again....... My hummer was brought up from the states just for me. I know rob wants to hide behind Nikki's Avalanche saying its the same wireing but I'm afraid he is wrong again. My buddy has a 07 hummer also and his lighting system works as it should with the turning knob on the dash to turn his lights on and off at leisure (day or night) but yes it has drl's but not it park.  My lighting switch was useless to me after my ROAR experience as it was impossible to turn my lighting system off at night( in park, emergency break on, tried everything). On is on and that's it. Never mind that little turn knob. That's just there for show as far as roar is concerned and I'm full of BS because Nikki's avalanche is the same way. In robs defence he did install the same remote start in it as is in my hummer so I could see why Nikki's Avalanche doesn't work too. Do they have anything in common ? don't know, Or was it his hack job talking out the old remote start ? Still didnt know. Thank goodness my new installer has figured out all of roars mistakes and hack job taking out the old remote and got me back on track.(at a cost of course)  \nSo that's the remote and lights out of the way now. Let's move on to the smoking in my ride. Like I said I'm a contractor... I know what cigarette smoke smells like and what soldering smells like. But I guess he has to defend him self by saying something. I think most people know now a days what cigarette smoke smell like. \nAs for guaranteeing there work. Yea as long as you don't come back. Lol. \nAs for the video ! Let's see it! Post it on YouTube. The last five minutes UNCUT ! From me walking back in and asking for my keys back, To me and my wife leaving. Lol Rob and myself both know, Nikki more than Rob but still Rob was freaking out yelling about how nothing is his fault and remember I was such a nice guy I even offered to buy the harness Rob was freaking out about he had to special order in and he wouldn't sell it to me because they were so mad and yelling ! In robs comment to my comment he said it was unprofessional of them not to sell it to me.( because they were freaking out) Makes you wonder now doesn't it.  Once they freaked out My wife did raise her voice for a minute over the alleged kill switch they lied about. I would love to see the video and audio. Show everyone how crazy mad they were and how calm I was.  We all know that he will never leave a YouTube address to it on Yelp or text it to me and I'll do it, because he's lying again.   But remember if you do UNCUT ! People like Rob at Roar like to say all sorts of things, but back it up with the video and audio ? Won't happen. \n\nAgain. Don't walk away from Roar Truck and Auto Accessories.....RUN. \n\nI don't expect a response this time. \n\nOne last thing, because I'm the honest one here, They did text me (real professional) to say the remote was in a week and a half later, after I bought another one. Unfortunately I could not be the one to pick it up and show roar my lights working.

I got there after 8pm since I was starving and not in the mood to cook dinner so late, I decided to give this place my full attention. I noticed the details as far as the Jamaican music in the background, the d\u00e9cor made me feel like as if I am somewhere lost in Jamaica by the sea. Only the sultry breeze and ocean were missing. There was only one lonely chicken patty left so I ordered it plus ordered the oxtail with white rice and cabbage with carrots. I ate the patty first and was blown away by the flavor,  I had to look around to make sure I wasn't somewhere in Brooklyn. I can only imagine if they have a Labor Day parade party in there, it would be a success because their food is already authentic and flavorful. This was my first visit there and not my last. I will make sure to stop by again maybe on Saturday to get some more patties. This patty had my eyes closed and toes curled and when that happens, to me that's a good sign. Not at all disappointed and the employees there were very approachable and nice. I had my food to go and splurge at home, I ate my patty before exiting Ocean Blue and got so excited, wish they had more patties. Again, I was blown away.

Now, when it comes to patties, I go for texture and taste of the meat. First I had the chicken which had spice but the crust of the patty to me wasn't all that great, a bit soggy which I think they put them in the microwave, to me that's a no-no with Jamaican patties. Patties to me are supposed to be flaky and the meat should have good spices. Both patties were ok, not all that thrilling.

It is one of thousands of Loblaws...NOPE. You thought wrong. This is no ordinary Loblaws. This is T H E  Loblaws.\nFirstly, I'd like to point out the mammoth size of this place. Golly gee wilikers! There's a Joe Fresh and an LCBO upstairs, on the main floor is where the party's really at. So, at your local grocery stores, or even superstores, you've got your grocery isles, and deli, pastry, artisan, etc. sections, right? Cool.\nThis place has a CHEESE WALLL DOE. Tell me how many grocery stores you've seen with a CHEEESE WALL. They have not a deli section per say, more of a deli CIRCLE. Also, they have a Tea Emporium, a CHOCOLATIER (WHATTT!!), a bakery section with more variety, and selection than most bakeries that are devoted to just being a bakery has, there's a sushi corner, a cafe, talking holographic mannequin type signs, a salad WALL, opposed to the overplayed and boring salad bar, sitting areas smack in the middle of the entire store, artisan breads area, and the list goes O N N N N. They even give out samples of food, almost like a prettier, miniature version of costco.\nNow, you're leaving the interactive specialty section to get to the actual grocery store.\nIt has rows upon rows upon rows of everything, and anything your heart desires (within grocery store reason obviously). The lighting in here is brilliant, the isles are wide, the colours are vibrant! Albeit, an ugly orange, but vibrant nonetheless.\nThey also offer underground parking, and there's escalators to get up to the shopping level. What about my cart full of groceries? You ask. Fear not! They have grocery cart escalators!! Completely safe and separate from your escalator journey! \nThe first time I stepped foot into this place was when it first opened, I was blown away.

They weren't completely full, but still at about 75% capacity of their smaller restaurant. It was also happy hour, so we got the full menus, happy hour menus, and a nice order sheet for the sushi so we could just mark what we wanted on that. Waitress was at our table immediately to take our drink order. She was super polite, and extremely efficient.\n\nWe ordered 3 rolls and the gyoza appetizer. The Spicy Yellowtail roll showed up within minutes, followed shortly by the gyoza. Both were amazing. I'm usually not a dumpling fan, but these were lightly fried and crispy on a bed of sauce. The yellowtail roll was extremely flavorful compared to other places we've eaten. We barely finished those before our Shimogamo and Las Vegas rolls arrived. Nice presentation, and we were both amazed at how you could taste all the distinct flavors separately in the rolls. The touch of lemon in the Shimogamo roll was just perfect, and seemed to only come through at the end. \n\nI'm no food critic, but eating here made me want to try to describe the food like one.

I reached for the tea bag and flipped it back and forth looking for the word \"decaffeinated\" on it and found none.  My fault too for not checking since I was given the tea packet.

I'm also planning on opening up my own breakfast cafe in the near future, so visiting and comparing various breakfast places is also helpful for my own market research. \n\nBecause of the beautiful weather, we decided to sit outside on the patio. It was about 1 in the afternoon but we were seated right away. I found the menu to be a bit too busy, whereas my boyfriend liked the layout of it. We were served water right away, which was presented nicely in a tall, thin jug. Even though it was our waiters fourth week on the job (he informed us later), he was friendly and efficient. \n\nI did quickly take a look at the interior. I really liked the unique layout of the bar area, a real eye-catcher once you enter. However, the rest of the restaurant had more of a diner feel to it accomplished by booth seating, which wasn't anything special.  \n\nWe ordered coffee ($2), which my boyfriend thought was a bit watery, fresh large orange juice to share ($4.25) and I had The Standard breakfast ($9.25) with poached eggs and bacon. Our orders came out about 10 minutes after ordering. The poached eggs were in their own little container, which I liked; less mess! Although they were a bit too runny. The bacon was not as crispy as I would like it, but very tender. The rye bread was pre-buttered (always a favorite), and the fried sliced potatoes had a hint of paprika on it which was lovely. I wasn't a huge fan of the green salad as it had no flavor to it; a bit of dressing would have made a difference. Although the addition of blueberries was nice visually and to the taste. I also liked the addition of a slice of melon; I have found it's always good to pair off greasy food with a bit of fruit as it seems to take away from the greasiness.\n\nThe total bill was $34, a bit pricey, but for the nice seats, beautiful weather and great portion sizes, it was worth it. Definitely a place I would come back to.", "date": "2011-05-09", "cool": 0, "user_id": "MGU_MeGj51wBjhD0T8vUgA", "business_id": "nu-DHeDtxnOW5vYj93dGPQ", "stars": 4}, {"useful": 2, "funny": 1, "review_id": "I9RjHgYvhlNUAGehRMAIdA", "text": "Myself and my party stumbled upon this place by pure chance as we were actually heading to another brunch place which apparently was closed...on a long weekend!!\n\nMy first impression was spacious! And I just loved the cute little bar, back rest counter high white stools and a full drink selection. Only around for a year and a half, it seemed to already have made a name for itself, with its handful of cut out newspaper reviews proudly framed on the wall as you walk in (and the first thing you would see, which was a nice touch to the place). We guessed from the blown up photo of some dude in a chef outfit crossed armed and full of attitude was the owner/chef himself. All this gave a nice personal touch to the place.\n\nOnce seated, we were served right away by an eager waitress. I ordered the 'Breakfast Special' ($9), although you're tempted to say 'I'll have the Breakfast Special 9' as the number '9' reads as part of the dish name instead of the price itself, perhaps something that can be improved on just for ease of clarity. After the fumble, we were reassured that many make the same mistake. Tea or coffee was included in the special, so I ordered earl gray tea, which was served in a small teapot compressor.\n\nThe menu was the actual table mat, blue and white in color with a fair selection of items. We noticed that their smoked meat sandwich's were a big hit, something to try for next time. We also noticed that the milk was annoyingly served in a small tin container, and there being 5 of us in total, it became a bit ridiculous asking the waitress to keep making multiple trips back to the kitchen to keep re-filling the tiny buggers!\n\nFour of the five meals came out after a 30 minute wait; my boyfriends came out 15 minutes after that. This was a bit annoying to be honest, but compensated for after receiving an apology from the waitress along with a five dollar coupon for our next visit (we're easily pleased) always a nice touch and appreciated. Although for that even extra nice bit of touch (going the extra mile as they say) it would have been even nicer for the 'don't mess with' owner/chef guy to come out in person and apologize for the long wait. I never understand why some restaurants don't do this, it shows the restaurant cares just that little bit extra, changing the customers opinion of the place from 'I got a fiver for my next visit' to telling their friends about it. I saw Mr. attitude himself so he was there.\n\nThe meal was nice and the portion size just right. Eggs were a bit too runny, always a favorite! But their hash browns were yummy, complimented very well with the apple sauce addition. Their bacon was a bit too hard and their fruit salad was just that, fruit! Nothing really here to get me to come back, although I wanna try that meat sandwich!!\n\nThe total bill for the two of us was $27, not bad for what you get.

I took it in Monday, asking if it being done by Saturday would be a problem. I was told that it would be close, but no. It would be fine. \n\nI had to go back in on Tuesday so the main seamstress could see what I needed done. After waiting 10 minutes for him to meet me there (he said be there at noon and he was very late), he seemed very mad at me for making him go in. I got the sense he was not interested in this job and definitely not in the customer. He removed all of the pins from the previous day and put in ONE pin on the inner slip. I asked if he needed more and he grumbled no. He would hem both pieces up using the one stitch as a guide. He also pinned the sleeves and shoulder. I showed him the image of the dress several times so he could get a reference of where it needed to fall. \n\nI never got a call back, so 6 hrs before I needed the dress, I called and found out it was done. I tried it on and to my dismay, the bottom was not done. If it was, I could not tell as both slips were still inches on the floor and I could still not walk in it! The 2 workers there were very nice. They tried to figure out what to do. I wound up getting some temporary stitching that pulled the dress up about 4 inches. I overheard them say that since I was so polite and didn't raise my voice, cuss or yell at them, that I should get some form of discount as the dress was not done properly.\n\nThey insisted (I offered many times to pay) I take the dress without paying and they would have the owner call me on Monday to work out a discount. When she called, she sounded very mad about it. It took a few tries to explain why I left the store without paying and then she told me in an extremely stern voice \"You know, you still have to pay.\" Ummm. Yes. I know. I told her the girls were the ones who suggested a discount and she said I just needed to come in and have the guy do the stitching in a permanent way and discuss the dress with him. I don't need the dress again, or to speak to such a rude person again, so no thanks. Then she spent the next few minutes complaining about how her worker isn't going to be happy with her at all as he wont get paid. She also kept saying that he was confused about why there was only one pin (that he put in) in the dress, and that he didn't know or understand what I wanted. I reminded her that she was there when I showed him the pic, gave many explanations of what I wanted. I wasn't sure how long they needed, but Tuesday - Saturday didn't seem like it was an impossible mission. \n\nI've decided, after dealing with this all, that I am going to pay the full price because they care about some very rude employee who didn't do HIS JOB more than the customer who tried to remain polite throughout a thoroughly bad situation.

I'm admittedly doing neither mainly because I did love the food and it was already halfway gone when I realized I should have taken a picture.\n\nWhy 3 stars? I came here with my mom who had heard about the restaurant in an article and wanted to try it out. We went in for lunch at about 12:45pm and even though the standing sign outside displayed their hours and said they were open, the sign on the door said closed. We tested the door anyway and found it to be open.\n\nMe made our way inside and were struck by how dark it was (it was a cloudy day outside and there were no lights on in the restaurant) and secondly by how empty and bizarre it felt. The only light coming in was natural from the windows. The music added to that obscenely strange atmosphere. It was the WQED station on the radio playing a rather dark and mysterious piece.\n\nNeedless to say, we stayed, and enjoyed a wonderful meal. However, service was a strange element as well. It took 20 minutes or so for food to come out which is fine but once we were finished with our meal, we waited half an hour looking for someone to take our check.

Though I prefer to lodge elsewhere, I didn't want to separate myself from the group, so I took a deep breath, and dived into the place that I was so happy to check OUT of a couple of days later. \n\nMy feeling of dejection began the moment we pulled into the garage. Everything is tightly packed in the garage, so each time we turned a corner to ascend to the next level, I had to close my eyes out of fear of that we'd scrape the car against a pillar, or another vehicle. In the garage, there's an elevator, which takes you to the casino level of the main building. The elevator is as dirty and raggedy as something you'd see in a rundown portion of an old NYC subway station. Unlike many other hotel/casinos, which have adequate ventilation systems, to counter the smoke, this casino floor smelled like a tobacco factory. I will give credit to the check-in staff, however, they were very friendly, and a pleasure to interact with! The rooms were ok, nothing special, but it was clean, no bad smells, and I did have a decent view of the strip (8th floor). It's an older no-frills place, so I wasn't expecting marble floors and stone counter tops, so I was ok with what was there. The only issue that I had inside of the room was the shower. The shower heads have only one pressure setting, and it feels like needles pricking your skin. Otherwise, the accommodations where aligned with the pricing of the facility. \n\nI'd say there's a very low likelihood that I'll ever lodge at Hooters again. For me, it's definitely more worthwhile to spend the extra money and stay someplace directly on the strip, with a higher star rating. For the drunken Las Vegas visitor, who just needs a place to sleep, then this is the place for you.

We were a large confused group, so again not necessarily all their fault. \n\nI love the atmosphere and ambience. A little loud, which creates a fun vibe. \n\nThe food, for me is the reason I keep giving this place a try. The steak is really good, and I love the fried chicken. The other people in our group seemed to really enjoy the food and craft beer they make. \n\nThe sticky toffee dessert is good, but not exceptional. Asked for a coffee to go with my dessert but apparently coffee is not on the menu either. Sigh. \n\nThe food is really good, but I would love to see them add some better wines, cocktails, and mocktails so that food and drink pairings work well.

But after yesterday, I have to say this place has probably been taken off our list of regular spots. \n\nWe decided to stop in on a Sunday afternoon for a bit of brunch before our 3 o'clock appointment. 2 hours should have been plenty of time, right? Apparently not. We were told the wait for a table would be about 20 minutes; 45 minutes later we were finally sat, after watching several tables remain empty on the patio the entire time we waited. Given those 45 minutes, we had plenty of time to look over the menu so we could put in our order right away. By the time we ordered our drinks and food (at the same time) it was about 2 o'clock. \n\nBy 2:30, I'd had enough. Our waitress didn't check on us the entire time we sat there. 40 minutes without a table touch... 30 MINUTES. We finally tracked her down and told her we needed our food to-go, as we had somewhere to be. She assured us she'd go check on our food and have them put it together as quickly as possible. But this seems to be relative, as 10 minutes later she returns and tells us it'll be another 5 minutes before our food could be brought out. Unfortunately at this point, we'd already decided to pay the bill preemptively because, despite everything, we were hungry. Bad move on our part, I will say. \n\nFinally, our food was brought out by (what I assumed to be) a manager, because she gave us a gift certificate for our trouble. However, this seemed to be only an afterthought when my husband brought up how long we'd had to wait for a table and for our food on top of that. I felt it should have been our waitress that tracked down a manager for that sort of thing. \n\nOn top of all of that, they put the wrong ingredients in my husband's order of the Bunny Rancheros. If the food was fantastic, I might be inclined to give them another chance. But, unfortunately, it's a bit average, and the headache is not worth it.

We had noted an allergy in the original reservation and after a phone call and promise of the allergy being taken seriously, it presented as the main fish on the menu. This limited our ability to partake in the 5 course tasting which is why we originally went. So we opted for 3. The food focused on small portions with unique gastronomy and plating. The taste and overall finish of the food could have been improved upon as my pork dish seemed under cooked and was leaking blood, it had the texture of raw bacon. The worst part for me was, I wasn't certain if this is how fancy restaurants cook meat and I was uncomfortable saying anything. The serving sizes are small but I suppose that is to be expected with the price of a multi-course dinner being so fair. So the reason I gave a three rating isn't because we hated it nor because we really liked it. It simply was an experience that we likely wouldn't repeat. We would rather spend our money somewhere that was more comfortable with larger portions and food that focused on taste and less on fancy cooking techniques (there was a lot of foam) and left us feeling fulfilled.", "date": "2017-08-08", "cool": 0, "user_id": "rSlsywnkymvlvggoGDCx3g", "business_id": "w9hczkpc2wtB63Z7dvYD3g", "stars": 3}, {"useful": 1, "funny": 0, "review_id": "7hDcQoidqL0MzYm_lfuehA", "text": "Outstanding Southern Fried Chicken!

No exaggeration, within 5 minutes of meeting the salesman, he told me he's on a diet because he is in his 50's and his girlfriend is in her 30's and he gets winded f***ing her. We get in the car to take it for a drive and he starts making comments about a woman walking down the street and tells me if she's still there when we come back, I need to go back in tomorrow because he's going to go pick her up. Then as we drive past Dream Palace, he starts talking about wanting us to stop and go in. He also told me his theory is why hang out with a 5 when you can buy a 10? We get back and sit down at the computer and he had to get a manager to enter something on the computer. While the manager was sitting at the desk, the salesman proceeds to tell the manager about this woman we saw. I can't remember the word he used to describe her. The manager seemed a bit freaked out while looking over his shoulder at the young woman sitting nearby with another salesman and shushed the salesman.

KBB says my trade in value is $26k, and fair market value to buy it from them is $30k.

It might appear pretentious to some, but the amazing, friendly staff have always consistently made me feel warm and welcome (I never once experienced attitude by anyone).\n\nI was also there last Friday and was served by the same server, Katie, who was just as attentive, friendly and warm.\n\nBecause I'm a regular, I've tried a lot of different things (but not everything because to keep things fresh and moving, they do change their menu every once in a while).  \n\nMy go to appetizer is always the zucchini chips - fresh, light, not over fried or dripping in grease, perfect crispness and a great aioli sauce to accompany them.  My second favourite is the polenta fries (not great when they're cold, so eat while they're still warm!).  My husband loves their spicy tacos and though I hate spicy food, I did try a bit and they were good.\n\nI will always highly recommend their short rib main - the beef is so tender that you don't need a knife.  This meat will melt in your mouth and you end up needing to pull pieces away with just your fork.  It's the most tender meat dish I've ever had; also came with root vegetables, mashed potatoes and gravy - perfect accompaniments (one friend substituted the mash with fries at a different dinner and it was nice, too).  To avoid myself from having it a third time in a row, my friend ordered it (gave me a small piece to share) and this time, I had the spaghettoni with seafood.  The pesto was great and it was nice and light.  Small scallops, but good size shrimps and definitely a good serving size.  \n\nFor dessert, I recommended the carrot cake to my friend and she loved it (I had some, too) and I ordered the phyllo-wrapped cheesecake with blueberry compote (to die for).  Both the carrot cake and cheesecake were incredibly moist, fresh, sweet but not too sweet and a good serving size.  I have a sweet tooth and though I love sweets, I hate when it's overdone and they do sweets here perfectly.\n\nThough we had finished our desserts and had just been chatting for a while, Katie attentively refilled our waters and coffee without asking and her great service made the experience that much better.\n\nIn the past, some of the other dishes I've had were the pizza (flat crust - nice and light), steak and frites (nice and traditional), salmon (also nice and light) and their burger (juicy, fresh and filling).  \n\nWe're coming here again...and again...and again...", "date": "2017-05-11", "cool": 0, "user_id": "pv0_1NonpTQN3n0J8QzDZA", "business_id": "GUXQCsnKIzSpRJcAbTT59Q", "stars": 4}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "yZxJJM2XemiyzMhqRKQVLQ", "text": "Ma boucherie pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 de loin, une \u00e9quipe de professionnel sympathique et des viandes local \u00e0 des prix comp\u00e9titif, que demander de mieux?

They had a small selection of sandwiches so I ordered lemongrass pork to take home.  While waiting on my eats, I decided to browse.

I love to cook, but I admit that many of the items I had no clue what they were or how to use them.  That's what made this place so fascinating for a culinary enthusiast.  I could have spent over an hour taking in the wide variety of items --they probably had more than 20 different kinds of soy sauce alone. If you're a fan of stuffed dumplings, they had a plethora to choose from.  I didn't check out their selection of loose specialty teas--they had many boxed varieties as well. \n\n I chose a few goodies for myself --my sandwich was waiting for me at checkout, and I had a chance to speak with the owner on my way out.  Seems this place has been here for about a year and the present owner purchased it 3 months ago.  I'll definitely come back when I have more time and am not so hungry.  Fast Fwd. to home-- the sandwich is delicious!  First,  I was impressed with the quality of the baguette--it was golden and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

I asked for my toast to be plain, but it came out with a \"yellow flavoring\" making it greasy and soggy. My eggs were cooked properly overeasy, I appreciate that (hence the second star in my rating). My hashbrowns had no color on them whatsoever.

When we got back to our hotel we immediately dived into our food anxiously and almost immediately dived back out. The food was terrible! There was NOTHING jerk about that jerk chicken (Seeing that I come from Jamaican background, I know a thing or two about jerk chicken). The \"unseasoned\" Mac n' cheese was tasteless and had 4 measley shrimp. We were definitely disappointed and will not be returning on our next trip to Montreal.

They do have a small adult pool - but get this - you have to have a reservation for chaise lounge or cabana to use it before 5pm everyday - which is not cool.  The staff was amazing - always friendly, helpful and nice.

Living on Roncy, I have been several times before (apparently I'm not a regular though--lol see below). The food has been good.  Not amazing, but good with good portions. Last Victoria Day Monday, I went with my family of 5 plus my mother for brunch. We did not have a reservation, and we were prepared to be shut out. But to our surprise, the host advised a wait of 15-20 minutes for a table for 6.  My wife and kids did some window shopping and I waited and chatted with my mom.  15 minutes turned to 25, but I assume that is par for the course and understand this is an estimate. We were asked a couple times by other servers about what we were waiting for. We were the only ones waiting and there were plenty of open tables of 2 and 4, but they did not offer to push 2 together, but again, I understand they want to keep their set up. After 30 minutes a woman, who appeared to be a manager or owner, came out and advised us that it would be another 30-40 minutes for a table of 6.  \n\nI was flabbergasted. I explained what we had been advised and that we had already been waiting 30 minutes. She apologized and said the person who had originally spoken to us made a mistake. She offered to put us in 2 back-to-back booths, but that wasn't going to work for us because we were there for a family brunch not just to eat. I suggested mildly that they could just push tables together (which would not have created any blockages). And her response to me (when no one else in 30 minutes had been waiting for a table), was that her \"regulars\" expect to be able to have those tables. What!!!!  I live in the area and had been there several times. What am I?  Chopped liver?  I was speechless at her unwillingness to address the \"mistake\" they had made and to try to seat us as soon as possible. It seemed like she just wanted us to leave. So we did. Wow.  \n\nI haven't really written a review like this before but I feel compelled. I was embarrassed in front of my family and I could not even relate to them the exchange in a way that seemed real.  Should I have made a scene?  It's just not my style. But I will certainly be relaying this tale to everyone in the 'hood.   \n\nWe ended up going to The Westerly, which I had not yet been to, two doors down. And I'm glad. We had great food (better than Sunrise) and infinitely better service.

It is extremely convenient to my home/work so I figured I would try them out. Well, this was my mistake. I did not do any research, which is very unlike me, so please please please read this! \n\nTook the car in for an initial estimate, was told ~$2,000-2,500. I get it, they haven't taken the car apart to see everything that was wrong with it so more than likely it would be more. Was told the front bumper, headlight, radiator, air conditioning, and a few other things. I left that day to think over what I wanted to do and about a week or so went by and I decided to just take it to have everything fixed.\n\nYes I was told they could not give me a definitive date. I was ok with that. They proceeded to tell me that the adjustment to the initial estimate went up to $3,400. Ok, I was covered for the majority of this so I said ok. Come to find out when all was said and done that they had charged my insurance $6,200. I was never notified that there were additional costs and my insurance company was even quoted around $5,800 or somewhere close to that. Kind of shady.\n\nMoving along, this is where shit hits the fan! I brought my car in on July 9 and dropped it off at 7:30am. I was told I would get a call back that evening for an update. No call. I call back the next morning and they tell me that they haven't completely finished looking over my vehicle and I would get a call back by lunchtime......no call. I finally receive a call at 5pm to tell me that they have ordered the parts and they would arrive at the beginning of the following week. By Tuesday they call me to tell me that all the parts have arrived and hopefully I would get my car by the end of the week. No car. I spoke to Jacob and he told me that sometimes when they have other cars that they are trying to get out and are closer to being finished that they would need to stop working on my car and attend to them first (not something you tell a client FYI) Also, they told me my AC would not be covered...not what they initially quoted me. So, I patiently await, another week goes by,By this time it is now Friday, July 24. They call to let me know my car is available for pick-up. So my bf goes to pick it up for me, the radiator that they replaced is leaking......are you kidding me?!?! So the GM says that they need to fix the issue. I had called their corporate office that Friday evening bc I was so livid. I received a call back from Kevin Holmes (DM for Abra) the following week trying to rectify the situation. Initially they were trying to get me to pay for the part out of pocket at cost with no fee for labor ($650-750 I cant remember exactly) Absolutely not! After he talked to the GM and realized that they almost gave me a car back that was still broken, they offered to pay for the AC to be fixed. And yet another week goes by that my car has to stay in the shop for them to replace the radiator they already replaced and fix the AC issue.\n\nKevin Holmes was the only good thing that came from this situation. He took over the situation and became my point of contact. If I could give individual reviews I would give him 5 stars and the auto body shop a 2.5.

If you're not into combing racks for buried treasures resale shops may not be the places for you.  For me finding great deals on some awesome clothes is almost like winning a game even though your team was down with only 5 seconds left on the clock.  Perseverance plus dedication to the win (landing multiple good deals) = VICTORY!  However, if you're not as hard core as I am but still like going to the occasional resale shop let me help you navigate this store.\n\nThe Wearhouse is very well organized and divided into two sections.  The front section of the store is consignment which includes the designer brands.  I've seen brands from Marc Jacobs and DVF to J.Crew and Seven for All Mankind.  These items can be a bit pricey but you can still find some really good deals.  Towards the back of the store is the thrift section.  Some of the brands I've seen in this section have been Express, Forever 21 and those that can be found in any typical clothing store.  The thrift items are significantly less expensive than the consignment items but there are more to sift through.  \n\nThe great thing about the pricing of many of the items is that after a specific date the price goes down.  For example, you've just found a jacket in consignment in which your mind flashes through all of the different places you will wear it and the numerous compliments you'll receive.  When you snap back to reality you realize that although the jacket may enhance your life, it's a bit more than you want to spend.  No worries, just look on the price tag and there is information on the exact date in which the price will be reduced and what it will be reduced to.  \n\nAnother great perk about shopping at JLC Wearhouse is that there are sales all of the time.  There is also a frequent shopper program in which you can get 30% off of a purchase after you make 5 purchases of $25.  Sounds great right?  If I haven't enticed you to check out the store yet maybe a recount of my last shopping spree will!\n2 pairs of J. Crew pants\n1 pair of purple palazzo pants (Only $4! They are my favs!!)\n1 suit\n1 J. Crew dress\n2 cashmere sweaters (Banana Republic)\n2 shirts (1 of which was a Paul Stuart.

One of my friends told me that TJ's had a great wine selection so I decided to check it out and guess what, she wasn't lying.  I'm far from being a wine connoisseur so I appreciated the little cards that described the flavors of the wine and the perfect pairing.  I ended up getting 2 bottles of wine for about $12.  What'd you say girl?  You heard me 2 bottles, $12!\n\nSince then TJ's has been my go to grocery store especially since their products are predominately organic and chock full of natural ingredients.  Even though it's relatively small in comparison to other grocers  don't let the size fool you.  You can find everything you need from fresh produce, meats, frozen foods, snacks, household cleaning and hygiene products to the extensive wine selection.  \n\nAside from everything that you can find in the store the prices are really reasonable (Dare I say... cheap?) and the staff always seems so upbeat and happy-go-lucky.  I love it!  Definitely drop in next time you're near a TJ's.

As a result I thought the prices would be a little on the high side but man I was I wrong.  \n\nAs you enter you are given a card which keeps track of all that you order.  Instead of having to wait for a server to take your order you simply head over to your station of choice (pizza, pasta or salad) and place your order.  Be amazed as your food is prepared right before your very eyes.  You can order drinks from the bar or the food stations.  Once your food is ready you can take it back to your table and dive in.  \n\nI wasn't overwhelmed by the taste of my food but it's definitely some place that I would revisit.  The meal prices ranged from $7-$11 and for the portion size that I received it can't be beat.  This is also a great place for large groups.  Thanks to the order cards you never have to worry about splitting the bill.  Another great thing is that the evening I went there was live music.  A couple of my friends were even asked to join the musician in song and dance.  That made for a pretty entertaining few minutes.

The food is excellent!\n\nI've loved PDQ's Concord location since it opened, too. Until my last visit, that is (7.10.14). My family and I have eaten there often but this last trip was a disappointment. We were there around 12:30 pm and everything seemed normal--staffing, cleanliness, good customer traffic, ordering experience--until I picked up the tray for the four of us. \n\nMy chicken tenders (3pc. meal) appeared to be about 70% of the size I'm used to. Maybe that's imagination, maybe the H'ville location has me spoiled. Still, it's not what I remember from PDQ Concord. Chock that up to a subjective determination, but one that made an impression nonetheless.\n\nWhat was objectively different from every past experience is the temperature of those tenders. Usually they are too hot to eat without some cool down. Not so this time. The flavor was right but smaller and just warm = no bueno.\n\nAnd the fries were objectively unusual too. They were limp and a tad oily instead of their usual crispy. Luke warm, not hot. Very disappointing.\n\nSo, has People Dedicated to Quality moved to some \"make it ahead, hold it 'til it's dead\" production model? I don't know, and wouldn't think so.

Entry gates that break and take forever to get fixed. I could not tell you how many times cars parked outside got broken into also.  The grills never had any propane in them. Management was awful, and Mark Taylor is a joke. \n\nThere is so much more I could go on about, but let me just use this example to put it all in perspective. \n\nThe review from Scott M on this page, well you have to pay $25 extra for the trash pick up at your door and its not optional they make you pay for it, plus you also have to pay for the trash disposal fees on top of that.\n\nSo why would he leave that out of his review?\n\nWell maybe its because his wife Michelle M is the property manager for Pietra.\n\nAlso I found his review of Pietra when I followed his profile link from the one star review he made on Raintree Auto body in Scottsdale. \n\nA shop that did an awesome job on repairing my car, and a review that he gives that I believe as much as his review on Pietra.\n\n\n\n***Update*** \n\nThe only five star review made by Scott M, Who's wife is Pietra's property manager is now missing. Imagine that. \n\nSincerity Definition: the quality of being free from pretense, deceit, or hypocrisy\n\nYet Pietra's property Manager, and Mark Taylor employee Michelle M did not address the fact  that her Husband Scott M made a glowing 5 star review of Pietra were he compared Pietra to a resort. \n\nA clear violation of Yelps Content Guidelines as I listed the relevant section below.\n\n(Conflicts of interest: Your contributions should be unbiased and objective. For example, you shouldn't write reviews of your own business or employer, your friends' or relatives' business, or businesses in your networking group.)\n \nNo she instead thanked me for my feedback and then attempts to make one think that it is better, when little to nothing has changed besides new motors for the entry gates. \n\nI think yelp readers would rather have a sincere explanation and an apology instead. \n\nInstead she just ignored the issue, and then tried to provided more reasons why Pietra is so nice. \n\nTo me that says it all. \n\nNow\n\nAs far as a Security Patrol.\n\nWell Michelle M the property manager states \"we have made a lot of improvements here at Pietra.\"  in an attempt to make it sound like it is a new service, but that was there when I lived there, and is more of an on call service as they are not on property all night long. They were slow to respond and and almost never on property. \nThat would be the reason in Michelle M's response she states ( \"We have a courtesy patrol service that is AVAILABLE after hours\") \n\nAVAILABLE in that statement being the key word.\n\nSounds to me to be misleading.\n\nAs far as increasing the number of dog waste containers.\n\nBig deal as it does not change the fact that people still have to have the desire to clean up after their dogs, and management needs to do a better job in both enforcement and clean up. \n\nNow for what they call Valet Waste Disposal. \n\nMichelle M may have tried to make it look so affordable at just .83 cents per day in her response, but that still does not change the fact that they make you use the option for an additional $25 fee as you can not opt out. Plus again you still have an additional waste disposal feel as well to take the combined trash away in the dumpsters. \n\nOh and that reminds me about how so often the residents dirty smelly trash would get piled high up outside the dumpsters. It looked so nice every time you had to drive by it.\n\nBottom line is that my advice is to stay away from Pietra and any Mark Taylor managed property\n\n\nThese are of course my opinions based on my experiences with Mark Taylor and Pietra.", "date": "2013-09-26", "cool": 0, "user_id": "Zj_jtU6B2d6rHaOE7LYmQA", "business_id": "ZfMUFpWaC-DHksEeJSYnAw", "stars": 1}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "iuJOQuX5On1vtIAmc3xqRw", "text": "Terrible tasting Italian.

When we got there that was not the case. We had to wait for about 20-30 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us and then when they did they gave us the keys to test drive the car, alone- not telling us a single thing about the car. When we got back from the test drive we were met with a sales guy who finally told us a little about the car and agreed it had some quirks (Messed up leather seat, no backup camera, odd controls but this was a Volvo and they are a Nissan dealership so we didn't question him too much)\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of looking around in the car we decided to start the negotiation ( we had been looking for this particular car and so it didn't take much for us to decide). We headed inside to start the process. \n\nWe started our offer low- who doesn't at a car dealership and they were \"offended\" and didn't think they could make it work. After back and forth we decided to walk away from the car. They were rude and basically impossible to work with so we decided to leave and were ok with finding another car to avoid working with them. \n\nThe next day they sent me 2 texts and called me several times \"wanting to make things work\" so we offered 23,500 ALL CASH and we would pick up the car within a matter of hours (the car was listed at 23,339 + tag and fees which totaled 24,400). After getting no where with them because they didn't budge on price after calling me and wanting to make it work we offered 24,000 all cash (we are now 400 dollars apart) and they said no...\n\nI finally said forget it because they were so rude and disrespectful but they KEPT CALLING ME offering 24,300 and then 24,200- At this point I was so offended that they came down 100 dollars and I said heck no and walked away.\n\nIn summary, I would NEVER recommend this dealership to anyone.

My interview was at 2. I took it in about 1030-1045ish. I left at 130. It took them forever to even look at my car ( there were only 2 others in the lobby). My car was overheating because my radiator hose was craked. They had to order the part. I was driving far and didnt want to break down so i said do it. It was a time crunch, they attempted to sell me brakes but i just said i was in a hurry. So i go in the other day to get a brake quote. I got there when they opened. They were working on another vehicle. I wasnt in a rush so i sat myself down and waited. Two hours later and multiple people with dignostics on their vehicles later a servicr guy tells me that there is multiple things wrong with my cars brake. And basically he wanted to replace quite a bit. Total estimate $650. I explained it was a lot of money to shell out at one time. I started to get suspious when he mentioned there being wetness on my radiator. This last week was raining like crazy. I told him they had checked for a leak last time i was there and that couldnt be anything. I probably ran through a puddle. He showed me my brakes in the shop and i asked if it wasnt fixed would i be able to stop if nessecary. He said he wouldnt recommend it and was very friendly. I told him that was going to discuss it with a friend whose parents are mechanics. He said he understood and walked me back into the lobby. I waited for my car to be put back together but when he came back he had a completely different attitude. He never made eye contact, told me that i didnt have to pay anything because it was a free brake inspection. I asked if i could have the quote. He rolled his eyes and printed it out. Ive worked in customer service for 6 years, it was just digusting how he was acting. I had my brakes looked at by a family friend. They werent as bad as they made it out to be.

We talked while she worked, which at other places always made me feel a little embarrassed to engage in conversation with someone working on my feet, and it definitely felt more like having a friend over for a spa day then someone just working for your cash. You can tell she loves what she does. As it turns out, Kimmy has been doing nails for a long time, has gone through different beautician schools and programs and has all kinds of certifications. \n\nAs for my nails themselves, I did want to keep things simple as traveling is not as fun when you have to mind your nails at every turn, but Kimmy managed to keep them on the shorter side and still make them look great.

Our server (I didn't catch her name) promptly sat us and got us drinks without any rush at all.\nWe ordered our food and with her quiche, there was a small side salad.  Now my better half is deathly allergic to vinegar, so she just put it to the side. When our server came to check on us, she asked if everything was okay with the salad, and we told her about the vinegar allergy, and apologized for not mentioning it prior. She asked if she wanted a different salad, but the quickly realized that all the dressings had vinegar in them. So she offered us not only a side of fries, but truffle fries That was very nice of her to offer.\nNot once throughout the meal, did we get an inkling of them wanting to rush us out. In fact, as we were finishing up, we asked for a \"to-go\" cup for her coffee and the gentleman behind the counter offered us fresh cup for the road. Wow! And he even made her a latte instead!\nSo we paid the check and on the way out, the same gentleman behind the counter asked if he could have a minute of our time. After that, of course.

He asked if we had tried any of their fresh pastries and we nodded no (I think he noticed my better half drooling on the glass pastry display as we walked in and waited to be seated).

We had never visited the space, which was previously Hoggy's. As usual, we took a quick look online. The website seemed to be still under construction, but the menu was very promising. We decided to check it out on Taco Tuesday and are really glad we did!\n\nThe first thing we noticed was the awesome patio with an open-pit fireplace and oak barrels all around. Very inviting, and I suspect we will find ourselves there often this summer. The interior entrance is expansive and surprising. Straight ahead is a two-level dining room with both intimate tables and long tables suitable for community dining and large parties. We were told the upstairs is mostly for events and large parties as well as overflow for the busy weekends.\n\nWe opted for the large bar area because it seemed lively. We immediately noticed the intriguing, rare craft beers set along the bar, and the incredibly extensive craft beer list. We learned that they rotate this list monthly and the beers are all-craft, no-crap. Cheers to that!\n\nThe menu has something for everyone, with many local ingredients, and I was thrilled with the multitude of vegetarian options. Since it was Taco Tuesday, we felt compelled to go with that menu. I had the Vegan Unicorn Tacos, made with crispy seitan, a local radish slaw, arugula, and a sweet chili sauce to finish. They were so bright and flavorful - a great blend of sweet with a little kick of spice. The husband had a Spicy Shrimp Taco - perfectly cooked shrimp that popped, with well-balanced flavors and a fresh cilantro finish, and an Asian Chicken Taco which he did not like as much - it may have just been his order, but the orange-soy glaze overpowered everything else. He had also been eyeballing the free-range turkey burger on the menu, and decided to try that as well. It came on a brioche bun and he subbed in some garlicky green beans rather than fries. He said it was really good and he'd get it again.\n\nOur bartender, Caspian, took good care of us, and answered all of our many questions, offering up additional information on nightly specials, music and brunch.", "date": "2013-05-24", "cool": 0, "user_id": "pN0o7vbzibvat_iM9hSsCg", "business_id": "cF98fzqrMnikhXhuSz6ruQ", "stars": 4}, {"useful": 3, "funny": 3, "review_id": "nqRav_2br1P-7AMb8xaUAg", "text": "My first visit there was not a good one.

I've been curious about all the alternatives to acrylic nails for a while (because I personally think they look kinda trashy) and I've got a mix of fingers that grow really strong nails while the others are always breaking. \n\nI noticed they weren't busy so I thought it'd be a great time to ask (it's taken me this long to ask because I tend to go when nail salons are zoos) and I feel weird asking tons of questions when people are obviously super busy.\n\nAnyhow, they gave me their best recommendation for something very natural looking but would last a lot longer than my shellac was...So basically something that met in the middle of shellac and acrylic.\n\nOh, and by the way theres a nail salon people should watch out for on Yonge close to St. Clair...they do awful Shellac jobs. I don't remember the name but it's a few doors down from Kearns and Co Hair salon (which is a GREAT salon btw.) I've done it twice there and they start to peel within 24 hours. All the shellac I had left was on my ring and pinky fingers.\n\nThe guy (I forget his name) asked me how long my nails already were or if I didn't have any at all. He took a look and saw that a bunch of my nails were pretty long, some pretty rough and he noticed my shellac. He explained a lot to me about how the shellac I got probably wasn't done properly and all that stuff 'cause it shouldn't be peeling, which is what I thought! \n\nFrom this point I ended up doing that cool gel thing (I don't even remember what THAT'S called--I'm 0-3 today -_-) he only had to add tips to two sad finger nails and matched their length to the rest of my fingernails. He spoke Vietnamese the most of the time trying to get me to practice mine (Ha! What a joke!) It was a great time! \n\nI felt kind of bad though 'cause there was this lady in there who was acting like a stuck up b***h, it turns out she's a regular, acts that way all the time and they just take it. She was doing things like helping herself their manicure water bowls for her dog, things like that bug me because I have a dog too, I love him to DEATH but I don't bring him to the nail salon with me among many other places!!! At least she provided a good source of entertainment. Okay, enough of that.\n\nMy conclusion? This is a great Down-to-Earth nail salon. I usually don't like going to Vietnamese run places because they look at me funny when I tell them I'm half AND because I feel guilty for not going to my aunt...LOL \n\nIf you're like me, want to get your nails done well and would prefer to hang/practice your vietnamese with soft spoken people as opposed to your aunt (or the like) that kind of yell at you, ask too many questions you don't want to asnwer and make you feel bad about your awful accent... come here!", "date": "2013-08-13", "cool": 1, "user_id": "lXlHJ_W-HP0XcdDGK15HHg", "business_id": "nC7uImTpwCgL8svHXTYPpQ", "stars": 5}, {"useful": 2, "funny": 0, "review_id": "HVUy15pDeGgk-PADOh5GxQ", "text": "Have been going to Pinnacle Lock & Safe for a little over a year.

A real business owner doesn't let his employees dictate what jobs he should accept.  Additionally if you really don't want to do this kind of job I suggest a better customer service approach to the situation like a referral to another company.

Drains clog weekly, power dims off and on..constantly switching out light bulbs from power surges.  The granite counter tops are nice but who cares with all of the other problems.  Utilities are extremely expensive easily add $500 to your rent.\n\nThe neighbors are okay for the most part, however their are a decent number of kids who are completely unsupervised running around the complex, trashing the computer lab & pool areas.  Some of the dog owners there are completely disgusting leaving dog crap on the sidewalk daily.\n\nThe pool area is not bad but teenagers invite massive groups of friends over and party like its spring break half of the time.  The computer lab is a joke, printer doesn't work most of the time (which is the only reason I would go down there).  Gym is actually not bad, open 24 hours which is nice.  Parking is terrible, I cannot emphasize this enough.  I have  never rented an apartment where a space is not included in your rent.  A handful of times on weekends I would have to park at Discovery Park and walk to my apartment before I caved into paying for a covered spot.  A number of times someone would be parked there only to find that the office would accidentally assign my space to someone else.\n\nThe staff is friendly but incompetent.  They could never coordinate with the maintenance staff correctly.  Something would always be \"misunderstood\", what work orders needed to be completed, which days, which times.  It was mind boggling how the right hand couldn't talk to the left hand.  When I gave my notice to move out they changed the locks on me the next day by accident.

We already moved 4 times in 15 years and this was the worse and most expensive. Let me give you some details:\nA) Packing of household property : One member of the crew broke a glass vase and unfortunately, my wife cut her foot. We expect that small accidents can happen during packing and moving of the household but we expect to be promptly notified so we can clean the damage and prevent personal injury. We were very concerned since we have a 9 year old, a 5 year old and a 17 month old that walked barefoot though the house!!. A member of the crew packed \"forbidden\" cleaning products such as opened bottles of bleach, ammonia, aerosols  and other chemicals. We had to unpack those ourselves and notified the crew leader. The master bedroom clothing was not appropriately packed since the shoes were placed on top of clean clothes without any paper in between, causing unnecessary stain of the clothing. Silk ties were thrown all together with belts in a box causing damage to the former piece of clothing. Kids markers, some of the them without the cover and unwrapped in paper, were also thrown in boxes mixed with towels causing staining. The United crew from our destination (this was a long distance move) found the furniture poorly padded and indicated that was the reason to find damage and severe scratches to several pieces of our furniture.  The carpet of the house was not appropriately covered and protected with consequent significant staining. A sales person came to our house to see that damage and recognized the error.  She asked us to clean it ourselves!!!\nB)Transport of the household: Unfortunately, all our household property was not loaded in a single truck as we were told. The driver indicated that this issue happens frequently during that time of the year since it is very busy for moving companies. I was told that I should not worry since the overflow load was going to be delivered at the same time than the main load. The initial load was delivered within those dates but not the rest of the household as were told. It arrived 10 days later! The inventory of the first load was incorrect and there were over 50 items without tag (more than can be blamed on transportation issues). Several items were missing and it was unclear to us if they were going to be present in the overflow load. This caused additional and unexpected expense. A critical item for us was the vacuum cleaner since 3 of our family members have  asthma and our new house had carpet in all the rooms. The vacuum cleaner was one of the items missing in the original inventory. My 5 year old son started to become symptomatic and we were authorized by Reynolds to purchase a vacuum and we were told that we would be reimbursed. \nC) Transportation of the automobiles: Our contract was signed for two different ways to transport and delivery of our two cars. The first car was supposed to be delivered within 5 days (at a premium price). Both cars were late. The worse part was the manager agreed to reimburse us for additional expenses such as the vacuum, dry cleaner bills and broken items.I was quite naive to pay them after  Reynolds agree to reimburse us.

The food at Bar 145 is relatively simple fare, with burgers as the feature menu item.  \n\nSo with 3 of 5 people in my party ordering burgers, I wouldn't see it taking more than 10 minutes to order and receive food.  It actually took 20 - 25.  To add insult to wait times, the french fries clearly had been sitting under a heat lamp (i.e. - not fresh from the fryer).  My wife's veggies burger was also lukewarm.  The sauces I asked to be on the side were actually put on the burger (no harm...but that wasn't the ask), and my kids burger didn't come with the tomatoes he asked for.  This level of service and quality surprised me for two reasons: 1) the place was almost empty, and 2) Bar 145 has been open now for at least a few months, which I would think quality and delivery times would have been worked out by now.  \n\nBy the way, this was my second time here, and service was really slow that time.

(Here's where it gets ugly) I had used my debit card to make the purchase.  When I checked out,  the cashier asked me \"debit or credit?\"  I told her \"it makes no difference to me, whatever is easiest for you.\" SO... when I tried to return this sweater, she told me it would be store credit only.  WHAT??  Immediately a 20 year old manager stepped in to clear up the situation.  She informed me that they can only offer store credit.  I informed her the purchase was made LESS THAN 2 HOURS AGO.  How about you just cancel the transaction, I asked.  Nope, can't do that either because it was a debit transaction.  I informed her of my previous conversation with HER cashier when given the option of credit or debit, I left it up to her  (duh, debit is cheaper, rule #1 when training a cashier) and now I'M being punished for that?!!  My husband happens to be in the credit card processing business and I KNOW FOR A FACT that a transaction can be cancelled with in a 24 hour period.

I have been here twice and if you are looking for a restaurant in Aria, you can't go wrong with this restaurant.  The restaurant is spacious and modern with a purple theme.  I liked the d\u00e9cor and is appropriate for a fine dining restaurant inside a higher end hotel on the strip.  The service is generally good (service was better during my first visit) and friendly with hosts and hostesses that seem to care.\n\nI ordered the signature tasting menu once and just had the maine dayboat scallops the other time (the chef tasting menu requires everyone at the table to order).  The signature tasting menu doesn't change a whole lot, but there are substitutions from time to time.  The proportions are good but those with bigger appetites might clean every plate and still feel like they can eat more.  The food tends towards rich, flavorful, but salty.  Maybe it was due to my choices, but going with wagyu beef tartar (very rich and oily), maine dayboat scallops (served in a rich brown sauce), and 48 hour beef belly (need I say more?) meant I was having a very rich meal.  The beef tartar could pass as an entree.  it was rich, oily, but very good.  The scallops, accompanied by mushrooms, were cooked perfectly and aremy favourite.  The beef belly melts in your mouth.\n\nI have tried both the wine pairing and the beer pairing.  The beer pairing was interesting to me and it was a lot of beer.  For $44 extra? It's a good deal in Vegas.  The wine pairings didn't always work but it didn't clash with the food and the proportions were fair.  I was surprised they didn't have a wine pairing for the 4th course which is the dessert.  Seems a bit stupid to offer wine pairings with their tasting menus and not finish it off with something to accompany the dessert.  Charge more if you have to.   My wine glass also happened to be dirty (if they were clean they weren't crystal clear) and exchanging it didn't really help.  I think they wipe their glasses with linen cloths that sheds. \n\nOverall, I liked the restaurant and will probably return the next time I return to Aria.  I think it would be better if there was a lighter fare choice on the tasting menu such as fish. Right now, the second course is either bacon wrapped rabbit saddle or scallops, while the 3rd course is either pork loin, beef belly, or wagyu sirloin.

I started seeing Desiree and never looked back.  I can say I had never found \"the one\" for a hair stylist before, but I loved everything Desiree did to my hair!  I was a regular customer for over a year and a half spending nearly $150-200 every time on hair cut, color, and product. Now comes my visit in February.  I had wanted to experiment with a darker hair color than I normal go, and the result was not something I liked.  I have never once called a salon to say I didn't like a service I revived and this was a big deal to me.  I got my hair done on a Friday and I waited a few days to see if I could grow into the hair or get used to it, but after a weekend filled stares to my hair and upon returning to work where men and women alike were asking \"what did you do to your hair\" and I could see their glances shift to my hair instead of my eyes I knew I needed to call. \n\nI was greeted by the receptionist who was more than willing to book an appointment free of charge (after I asked her how much it would cost to fix as I couldn't afford to put much more money in my hair after a $200 visit).  I then spoke with Desiree and everything seemed fine and was set up with an appointment the next day.  About 30 minutes later  I received a call back from Desiree (whom I will not speak bad of) who was under order from the owner of the salon to inform me that since \"I got the look I asked for (darker)\" they would charge me 50% of the cost to fix.  After that, I told Desiree I couldn't afford to put that much money into my hair (would have been another $60 or so).  I cancelled my appointment and she instructed me to wash my hair with dish soap.  \n\nI have never felt more betrayed or disgusted with customer service in my life.  It took 3 weeks of washing my hair with harsh and drying dish soap before my hair lightened enough for me to feel comfortable and people started to comment that my hair looked better.  It seems to me that my hair was a direct representation of that salon, so I had no hesitation telling anyone who commented on my hair the situation with customer service I received at this salon, and where not to go.  I had prior to this referred at least 3 people to this salon and would have continued to do so.

The last two times we've tried to go, we've have been completely unable to make a reservation.

Looked like a cool spot to hang out and wait for your movie if you were early, or even to it and chat, if on a date, after the movie.\n\nYou can purchase your tickets at the automated machines, or buy/pick them up inside at Guest Services.  \n\nThe employees were very cordial as we passed them on our way to our seats inside the theater.  We decided on the Cinema Suites, since it was 21&over.  We were impressed with the layout, and the very comfortable seats that recline.  Our server was very nice and informative.  I was surprised when she was entering our order into her pad, the other servers were bring our drinks and appetizers.  WOW!  That's faster and more impressive than a restaurant.  \n\nI had the sirloin tips and mashed potato's, and my wife had the fried shrimp with fries.  I can't comment on any mixed drinks, (another reviewer complained of watered down drinks) mainly because we had wine. \n\nAll in all, it was ok.  Kinda like food at an Applebee's, or Chili's.  Nothing to go crazy about, mediocre, and over priced, but it WAS a MOVIE THEATER.  I mean, It's not a Michelin Star restaurant.  I don't care that it is in the Biltmore area.\n\nThe thing that annoyed us the most were the 2 pompous couple's we sat between.  They constantly complained about something.  Mostly their refills.  The waitress explains to you, should you need something, PUSH the call button.  They never did.  They expected someone to come by.  The point of the call button is to minimize the wait staff running around disturbing patrons who are watching the movie.  \n\nThis is the main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. They were really annoying. \n\nIt's like this.......You are at a THEATER that serves food and drinks.  Not at a Fancy restaurant that shows a movie.  You're paying for the comfort and experience of being able to relax, enjoy a drink or dinner, all while watching a movie.\n\nBottom line, Food was ok, a little over priced, so watch what or how much, you order.  If you like to drink, have a beer, wine, or straight drink, if you are so worried of getting it watered down.  The employees from beginning to end were excellent.

He recommended the right treatment for my condition, explained why my skin acted the way it did, and honestly informed me of my options. He also provided at least 6 sessions of laser ABSOLUTELY FREE OF CHARGE when he realized my skin was very stubborn and needed more treatment. That is superb care, and I'm very grateful for it. Not to mention, the consultations are always free, and I received all the answers I needed and got a bunch of product samples without spending a single penny.

Good choice for first-timers as you get to try a little bit of almost everything.

Don't get me wrong, the oyster taste was still there and it's tasted really fresh.  Actually, this was given as a complimentary item by the Chef\n\nAlaskan King Crab with Creamy sunchoke, bacon, and paddlefish roe - I absolutely love this as an appetizer.  I love crabs plus add bacon and I'm a happy camper.  The flavors just melded well.\n\nHeirloom Beet Salad  with Duck Prosciutto, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Roasted Walnuts, and Celery Vinaigraitte - Light and fresh.  The dressing wasn't overwhelming\n\nFoie Gras Brulle with Salted Brioche, Toasted Cocoa Nibs, and Shaved Torchon - interesting way of serving foie gras.  We think the size is too big though for an appetizer. Maybe they can make the serving size a little bit smaller\n\nPan-Roasted Sea Scallop  with Jamon Iberico, Green Garlic Flan, Black Trumpet mushrooms  - scallops was cooked perfectly, flavors are just right and compliments each ingredient\n\nHerb-Crusted Lamb Saddle with Crispy Sweetbreads, Baby Fennel, Creamy White Polenta - lamb cooked and seasoned well.  I loved the sweetbreads!\n\n48 Hour Beef Belly with Shaved Purple Asparagus, Ramp Sorrel Puree, and Toasted Almond - beef is so tender it melts in your mouth.  \n\nGianduja Pave  - Olive Oil Ice Cream/Hazelnut Crunch/Basil Jam - Yes, you read it right.  Olive oil ice-cream???  I had my doubts at first but it was a really good plate cleansing item with all the flavors we just had\n\nStrawberry Profiterole - Vanilla Ice Cream/Lemon Sorbet/Chervil Mousse -  Light dessert, not too sweet,  flavors melded well together. \n\nService: Our server was attentive and really knows the menu that she can answer any question we have.  She also saw that I was not enjoying my cocktail since I am not really into citrusy drinks so she suggested to change it\n\nWe enjoyed our dinner and it was definitely worth the money we paid. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars for this restaurant was because they didn't do my request to bring out a cake for my husband as requested.  I made a note when I did the reservation requesting them to bring out a slice of cake for him but it was not done.

In return, we received a very inexpensive 3 night stay in Vegas. This was initially supposed to be a Summer Bay Resorts timeshare vacation, so we also received an Orlando vacation included in the low price ($350 for a 3 night Vegas stay, and 2 night Orlando stay with the option to purchase additional nights for $90 - 2 bdr, 2 ba \"luxury\" accommodations). At the last minute, Summer Bay switched us over to the BG 36 location, so that is how we ended up there. We had no other option, really, that late in the game.\n\nFirst the hotel: website alludes to \"luxury\" rooms throughout. In reality, they are nothing more than glorified hotel rooms with kitchens. Our 2-bedroom consisted of 2 side-by-side one-bedrooms with a connecting door. Furniture was cheap and uncomfortable. Our smoke detector battery died the first night, so it started beeping extremely loudly during the middle of the night, becoming more frequent as morning approached. Needed a ladder to get to it, so I couldn't pull the battery. Maintenance had to be called. \n\nNext, the dishwasher was loose in its cabinet so every time the door was open, the dishwasher just about fell forward - Not ideal with 2 curious toddlers running around. \n\nBeds were not comfortable, as stated. Carpet was so dirty that our feet turned black. Pool was indoors, and was not the relaxing environment that is portrayed. Pool bar was never staffed nor stocked - what's the point of promoting it? The sun deck was small - enough said. We went to the Flamingo for a day to go to a real pool.\n\nThe good: I asked for, and received, cribs and high chairs for free, and a room with a view of the strip, not the sandlots that surround the resort. The people that work for the hotel were very pleasant and helpful.\n\nNow the timeshare: First they don't call it a \"timeshare\" because it is a club that uses points instead of the traditional timeshare \"1-week per year at the same location\" club. This one allows you to use your points at anytime and at any BlueGreen club location (or others around the world). Sounds great, right? EXCEPT that when you read reviews, people all over are having trouble booking resorts for the dates they want - Rooms are booked or people don't have enough points because BG assigns higher point values to more popular travel dates!\n\nOur timeshare rep was pleasant, but new; so, she kept calling over sleazy and slimy managers to answer my questions. I say 'slimy' because these guys would sell you the shirt off their backs if they could, all the while pretending that they are interested in your life. They are your best buddy to your face, and always have an answer to your concerns about the timeshare. Yet, you also get the feeling that they don't give two-sh*ts about your life and just want the commission from your sale.\n\nMore details - We spent 60-90 minutes wasting our time while some phony comedian \"entertained\" the timeshare crowd in a different room. There was hardly ANY substance to his presentation, and could have been covered in 15 minutes. By the time we were finished with that and met back up with our timeshare rep, 90 minutes had passed. \n\nI asked what the buy in cost was at that point - \"We'll get to that\" is what I was told, and we had to go through the dog-and-pony show of them showing us the same rooms that we were already staying in (because we stayed in the same hotel). We could have skipped this as well.\n\nWhen we finally got to the details, it was $32k initial buy-in to get 20,000 pts per year - much higher than I was expecting. On top of that, there are $1200 annual maintenance fees! Of course, you can finance for %17 APR! What? I might as well put it on my credit card - it has a rate half that amount!\n\nI said I wasn't interested in paying that much and so the manager started coming over and offering lower and lower cost packages. The final package offered was 8000 pts every OTHER year - with an $11k initial cost and I still had to pay $500 maintenance EVERY year. \n\nI asked a question about the point costs per room and if they increase every year. The response was that \"no, for existing members, the point costs do not change once you are in the club. That future members' costs will cover point cost increases.\" Can you say pyramid scheme?? \n\nAfter finally saying no, OF COURSE they have one final offer - 9000 pt sampler plan, where I can try the program out for one year. The catch: It's $700 and you can't use it in June, July or August (surprise, surprise). I passed on it again, and was immediately met with much colder personalities by the rep and managers - which was not surprising. After reading the reviews on this and other websites, I did not want ANYTHING to do with this company. Total time spent was in excess of 3 hours...time that could have been spent with my kid!\n\nIn the end, I'm VERY happy that I passed on these offers.", "date": "2011-09-06", "cool": 0, "user_id": "H0wwbeDiPgxRSs-SW-T4hg", "business_id": "tNJkfAMdwznUX4l31cgq4Q", "stars": 1}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "muQzX8WBc-KLs2GqTySTFg", "text": "They don't take reservations so be sure to get there earlier than the dinner crowd. Luckily I went on a Sunday instead of a Friday or Saturday, so it wasn't as crazy. They also only take cash, i.e no credit or debit until further notice. \n\nFor a party of four, we ordered the following: (1) Singapore Laksa, (2) Green Curry Chicken, (3) Garlic Okra, (4) Mixed Beef and Chicken Satay Skewers (5) two orders of Roti and (6) a bowl of steam rice! \n\nFor dessert, we ordered (7) Teh Tarik and (8) Banana Fritters with Vanilla Ice-cream. \n\n(1) The Singapore Laksa noodles were soft, which is the way I prefer it. Their level is spicy is not too bad - you could probably survive without chugging down your water for this one! I enjoyed having the tofu, the fish slices, and other assorted foods in this one. I'd ordered this again, though if anyone has been to Gourmet Malaysia near Brimley and Sheppard in Scarborough, I'd recommend their Laksa over Restoran Malaysia's. \n\n(2) The Green Curry Chicken is a must-order whenever I visit. The green curry is spicy - so be sure to have some water ready. Still, I find it heart warming and absolutely love eating this with rice. The chicken itself is however a bit dry. If i had the option to order Green Curry with veggies, it would be my go to.\n\n(3) The Garlic Okra was scrumptious and fun to eat. The slice it up so for those who have some difficulties eating okra uncut, Restoran Malaysia makes lives easier! There was a good amount of garlic so it added flavour. While i thought it could have been less salty, my other party members thought it was just right. This bowl of Garlic Okra was gone the fastest, and it makes a great neutral veggie dish among other spicy orders. I'd order this again. \n\n(4) Mixed Beef and Chicken Satay skewers came with three beef and three chicken, along with some sliced cucumbers and a peanut-sesame sauce. Although I'm not exactly sure of all the ingredients that went into the sauce, it gave off a sweet, sticky, and sesame taste that complemented the meats well. The meats were well seasoned and not over cooked. They were easy to eat, and easy to share. \n\n(5) Another order that was easy to share would be the roti. It was soft, and went well with dipping into the Green Curry and even the Laksa for me. While I enjoyed it being soft, a party guest of mine thought the roti could have been crispier. \n\n(6) And lastly, rice may be rice, but Restoran Malaysia gives a generous portion for one bowl. It tasted like it was freshly steamed rice without over drying, and also went well with the curry! \n\n(7) Their (hot) Teh Tarik was not overwhelmingly sweet and probably \"just right\". It was nice to balance out the salty and spicy flavours with something sweet. \n\n(8) The Banana Fritters with Ice-cream took longer than I expected but perhaps they were getting busy around 7:30 pm. The banana fritters were not too doughy, and maintained their warm temperature. It certainly went well with the vanilla ice-cream. \n\nTheir service was wonderful. I didn't have any issues and the waiters/servers (we had more than one?) came by frequently to check up on us. \n\nI would certainly come again the next time I'm craving Singapore Laksas and Green curry, without wanting to drive all the way to Scarborough!", "date": "2015-12-13", "cool": 0, "user_id": "S_Tmek4sA3QZraCT_DCZGw", "business_id": "IRd0jvnfJ3tV6AMlYMajzw", "stars": 3}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "pQj4YxwJOfWXumcuT2PF6Q", "text": "Glad I found a place for my car maintenance that i can trust.

Last night, after 10 pm, Hot n Juicy was closed & we accidentally found this place called Urban Crawfish. Never been here before. It was around 10:25 pm and only one table was occupied. Late hours and it was understandable. Bit sketical but we decided to give it a try and ordered carry out. 1 lb Crawfish in spicy, 1 lb shrimp medium spicy & 1 lb shrimp extra mild sauce. What kind of sauces they were are not important in this review because everyone has different taste. Just because I didn't like their sauce doesn't mean it is a bad restaurant.  Different restaurant...different recipe. ...simple. \n   We got home & finally get settled to enjoy our late dinner on our day off. Well, very disappointing taste of sauce, but like I said, it's only personal preference.  I'm sure there are lot of people who love this recipe.  But Crawfish not being fresh? That's a totally different issue.\n   If you are Crawfish lover, like I am, you understand the joy of sucking the brain juice out of Crawfish. To me .... that's the best part. But at the same time It's also one of the nastiest tasting thing if it is not fresh. I tried 6 crawfish and ended up throwing them away. Just terrible. I've never been a review writer on Yelp. But paying $ & tasting  not fresh shelfish? Its just very difficult to tolerate.

At my last visit, they even offered to replace our meal if we were not satisfied. The door bell on the table is also nice to have, but can attract attention from everyone in the restaurant if used. \n\nFood: Not bad.\n- Pros: Usually I order my usual S15 Bi Bim Bap when I come. Very filling! The crunchy rice from the sizzling hot pot is my favorite!!  My BF ordered the mackerel, which was overall fresh and pretty well priced. It even came with a seafood soy paste soup.\n- Cons:  The small dishes offered fluctuate in quality and quantity. At my last visit, we only were given 6 dishes, we usually get at least 8. One dish was not even edible bc of how spicy it was. I was also disappointed that they did not have tea automatically served for you. You have to ask, or you just get water. The Korean rice tea is one of the joys of Korean dining. \n\nOverall: I would come back when craving late night Korean food.

When they brought out the sides that accompany the duck, I was disappointed that there is a huge disproportion of wraps compared to the carved duck skin, I mean almost 5 duck skins to 1 wrap, like they weren't making enough profit off you so they intentionally give you less wraps because you will ask for more and they charge you for more wraps - thus my 2 stars and not 3 for my review for this point.  Other restaurants don't charge you when you ask for more wraps!  Taste wise it wasn't any better than other restaurants I tried duck.  Their dishes other than duck are a better choice as it's heavy on flavour and sauce typical of northern Chinese cuisine.

Bartenders should socialize with patrons, here's a phrase to learn \" Hows your day/night going\"? a little chit chat goes a long way.

In the 90's this hotel was new, nice and accommodating, in 2013-not so much.\n\nThe hotel is now old, outdated, a bit dirty and most of the employees seem very unhappy.  We stayed here because we were on a family vacation and 2 of the 3 nights were free.  Next time I think we will pay the extra money to stay elsewhere.\n\nThe employees at the front desk are far from friendly.  After getting a room with a view of a block wall and no sky, we were able to change to a room with a view of the Luxor.  The front desk employee begrudgingly changed our room after I complained and explained to her what I was told when making the reservations (I was told we would receive a room with a view of the South Strip for no extra charge).\n\nThe rooms are pretty decent as far as decor and cleanliness go.  The bathroom could sure use a makeover, but was clean enough. The a.c. was the original unit from 1990. The casino is old, dark, dingy and not very lucky!  It was almost impossible to get a \"free\" drink.  I played for over 45 minutes nonstop and no waitress was to be found (and no winning either!).  I swear the casinos in Southern California have better odds of winning.\n\nThe swimming pool was down right scary.  My 8 year old son begged to go swimming, so we did.  He ended up getting sick and throwing up that night and I'm convinced it was the pool water.  The pool was filled with adults and kids from age 1 to 15, the water was too warm and very cloudy.  After getting out of the pool, I realized there wasn't even a hint of chlorine smell on our swim clothes, not good.  The restrooms in the pool area were absolutely disgusting.  I won't go into details, use your imagination, it will most likely be spot on.\n\nThe only reason I even give it 2 stars is because the prices are low and they have a pretty nice arcade for kids.  They could really use a 24 hour cafe type restaurant (they used to have one years ago).  You are forced to go to fast food, expensive eats or leave the hotel and go elsewhere.\n\nAll in all, I don't recommend the Excalibur unless you are on a really tight budget and are terrified of staying at Circus Circus (like we were).", "date": "2013-07-20", "cool": 1, "user_id": "gxGjqtKkq-7Z4Gpjw1JTSQ", "business_id": "o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w", "stars": 2}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "5elFYk4wR63jcMHcnxYGEg", "text": "I'm not a person to bash business or talk bad about them...but I made an appointment to get my eyebrows tattooed with Jenny Luu ( the shop owner) and I had missed my appointment because my father passed away.

I was surprised to see a Korean restaurant pop up in place of Los Mariachis.  I had a great experience here - cool ambiance, a sizeable but not overwhelming menu, large portions, and excellent service.\n\nAmbiance - The place has a dark interior with comfortable enough seating.  I enjoyed not having generic fluorescent lighting, and the fish tank added a lot.  Booths were available on the side walls, and there was a K-drama playing on the TV.\n\nMenu - One interesting thing about the menu is that after the Korean name for the dish, the explanation was in English, which I've found to be a rarity.  Unfortunately, there's no phonetic romanization of the Korean name, so you'll have to figure out the dishes from the descriptions.  There's also soju available.\n\nService - My servers were very attentive, constantly refilling water, giving us more rice, and helping to explain some things from the menu and which dishes were which.  They seemed like they could make recommendations pretty effectively, if you're not familiar with Korean food.\n\nFood - Again, the portions were pretty huge!  We ordered the jjamppong/champong (spicy seafood noodle soup) and the ojingo bokkum (spicy stir fried squid), and we had a hard time finishing the soup and finished half of the squid.  The noodles were good and very spicy - not overcooked, though I was hoping for more noodles - and the dish came with a whole prawn, mussels, and squid.  While I would have liked a larger quantity of seafood, I'd take quality over quantity.  The squid was hot and tasty, and had a large amount of scallions and onions.  I was especially happy that we had banchan (side dishes), about 6, and a steamed egg.\n\nPrice - Our dishes were pretty reasonable, about $9 each, but the price range varied a bit.  Obviously, the barbecue dishes are more expensive, but I was disappointed that the pancake appetizers were a bit pricier than I would have liked.

Being the first one is covered by insurance the other two cost out of pocket. \nHe was impatient with me because I was trying to get information about the third one he handed me a phamplet which did not explain all the problems with the multifocal lens only about halos. \nI was given no more than 4 minutes to \"hurry\" up and make mine choice. \nI did in fact choose the multifocal lens with the additional  $4,000 dollar out of pocket expense. I thought the savings if no longer needing glasses it would be a benefit. \nThen following day I had the right eye done, then the next week the left eye. A week later his final exam announcing 20/20 vision without any glasses needed. \nAfter my eyes healed I went about doing my shopping every single light in the stores had glaring bicycle sized halos I had to wear sun glasses in the stores. \nI found reading difficult unless it was in bright lighting because everything seemed dim. \nThen my first night of driving was horrific! The oncoming car lights had halos the size of truck tires to explain what a halo is. It's giant bright swirling lights I could barely see to drive forward I almost had to stop the car. The street lights and crossing lights also had giant halos. Between them all I had stop driving at night altogether. \nAbout a year later things looked fogy and dim I could no longer read thinking I needed glasses and now a waste of money for these lenses. My specialist told me fogging had in fact occurred behind the lenses, and needed to be lazered out several thousand dollars for that. Sure enough clearer but everything still seems dim. I find out from the eye exam specialist that in fact these lens need to be reglazed they use Lazer to do it. And that the original eye surgeon which was Parinderpal should do this as in Nebraska they have a ten year warren for theses lenses. That when redone I wouldn't need to wear glasses like before. \nI phoned Parminderpals office and I was told they would back to me, which never happened.  So I recalled his office and was quickly told No No warrenty!\nFor the extra amount of money I spent for these lenses it was a waste of money as well as very poor service from a doctor who doesn't bother to take the time with each patient to really explain things before he hurries off to see another patient. \nI do not recommend Parminderpals work or the multifocal lenses.

Again, I am told that because I booked through Tingo that they're unable to do anything. I felt as though I was being penalized for booking through a third party service. Why would you allow your hotel to be booked through it if you don't intend on providing the same service compared to if I were to book directly through the hotel. \n\nI spoke to one last manager when we checked out and she was the worst of them all. Not only was she rude and condescending she made me feel as though I were being unreasonable. If you were to book a hotel and it was filled with the scent of urine would you be happy? The manager then proceeds to tell me that going through Tingo is the ONLY way to get my money back. \n\nSo, I call Tingo and they tell me the opposite, that going through the hotel is the only way to get my money back and that they tried to contact the Monte Carlo and they are refusing to do so. So between the two companies I keep getting pushed around and bounced back and forth and neither are willing to assist in anyway. I cannot explain how frustrated I am, it is not about the money it is about the principle of the matter. \n\nBottomline: \n1. Don't ever book through Tingo, and be weary of booking through third party services as the hotels seem to act like they are unable to assist you when you do.\n2. Don't ever give the Monte Carlo any business. They clearly lack in cleanliness and any respect for their hotel and their customers\n3. I am in the serve industry and I understand that yelling and screaming will not get you anywhere which is why I kept calm and was very reasonable throughout this entire process. Maybe if I would have raised my voice someone would have listened. \n\nI'm a LOCAL from Vegas have been since I was 7 years old.

We only stayed overnight in the Select Tower, and it was booked through Expedia, which had a very low advertised price.\n\nThe room that we stayed in was good, the beds looked nice and the furniture/decor was modern, too.  I read some of the other reviews which said that their room looked outdated and worn.  I'm not sure if this depended upon which tower they stayed in, but I was satisfied with the room I stayed in.\n\nHowever, I do have to comment on a few things:  1)  the bathroom lighting is dim - there is only one light and it's on the vanity over the sink area.  The rest of the bathroom looked and seemed dark,  2)  The closet is rather tall and narrow, so there wasn't a lot of space to stow stuff if you have more than two people in the room, 3)  my sleep was marred by the presence of unruly and inconsiderate young twentysomethings who seemed to think that it was okay to be noisy and boisterous at 3:00 a.m. in the morning.\n\nIt is on this item that I am going to hit upon and expand upon.\n\nThe hotel, given its positioning on the strip, seemed to be dominated by the younger crowd, although everybody was represented there.  The casino area seemed to be lacking in energy like the other casinos I'd seen closer to the center of the strip.  However, the young crowd that I encountered probably chose the Stratosphere hotel because it was what they could afford.\n\nIf that really was the case, I shouldn't have been surprised that they would act in a way that was consistent with their self-centered personalities.  At 3:00 a.m. in the morning, a small group of people came down the hallway from the elevator bank and were talking very loudly.  So loud that they woke me up - not a wise thing to do.  I actually went to my room's front door, opened it up, and told them to pipe down or I'd call security.  Since they didn't seem to listen or care, I called for security to come up and check out my noise complaint.  Things quieted down shortly after I made the call.\n\nGiven that I could clearly hear them through the door, the doors must be hollow-core or made of something else that allows sound to be transmitted through fairly easily.  Regardless, because of the crowd that seemed to be drawn to this hotel, I probably am not going to come again.  I don't want to have to deal with obnoxious, immature people, and they were everywhere!  I encountered them in the elevator, in the halls, at the shops, and on the casino floor.  It was more painfully evident to me when I saw the crowd gathered at the Starbucks Coffee area outside of the elevators to the Select Tower.\n\nThe only real draw of this hotel is probably the observation deck in the tower, which paid guests can visit for free by swiping their cardkey.  Otherwise, you'd have to pay a hefty price for the privilege to go up there.\n\nSo, I give Stratosphere a low mark because of the clientele it attracts.  Knowing what I know now, I'm not going to subject myself or my family to the boisterous antics of immature adults.\n\nOh, and the adjacent neighborhood surrounding the hotel?  It seemed very ghettoish.  It felt like East St. Louis - depressed, dark, and run-down.  Even the motel across the street from the taxi drop-off area is closed and dilapidated.  A heavy atmosphere hung over the area as I drove around the hotel property.", "date": "2012-06-10", "cool": 0, "user_id": "hGFBl2ApoXoISNpyIuPMjA", "business_id": "ByFMv3p5X1aNeZhU61rDcA", "stars": 2}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 1, "review_id": "arGZk-VLbqnUZnfCDoKWmg", "text": "We choose Morton's Steakhouse for our \"Celebratory Dinner\". \n\nWe were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and my boys each had events to celebrate. \nThe personalized menu were a very nice touch and was not expected. \n\nAmbiance:  Average - my chair was hit approx. 6 times during my dinner.

Firstly, because it was in Vaughan and I live downtown where I am surrounded by a bunch of Pho places. Secondly, when I saw photos of the food I really had second thoughts about going. As weird as it sounds, I thought the place looked TOO NICE to be a good pho place. \nWhen I finally went, I decided I was completely wrong. The place was clean, looked very nice, staffs were very nice, the menu is quite big ranging from appetizers to Pho, Bun, rice dishes and vietnamese beverages. \nWe had Nem Nuong and Summer rolls for appetizers. The peanut sauce was thinner than I would have liked it to be but it was flavourful. The appetizers do come in quite small servings but the taste was very satisfying. I cant really compare the taste of their nem nuong to anywhere else in Toronto because the last time I ever had nem nuong I was in Vietnam. But it was very tasty.  Same goes with the summer roll. I quite liked the fact that it wasn't stuffed with herbs. It wasn't too over powering. \nFor the main dish, I had Pho Dac Biet. The broth was amazing. It doesn't taste like it had a whole bunch of MSG in it like at most pho places. It was light yet flavourful. Their beef cuts were thicker than most pho places and was very fresh and tender. The rice noodle used here is different too. It is not as wide, it actually reminds me of the noodles I had in Vietnam. \nThe size of their pho is really big too. Usually I order a large. My friend warned me and told me to go for the regular because it is quite big. And it really was. The regular was as big as a large in other places. So while the price is a little higher here than other pho places, the serving size is satisfying. This is probably the best pho I've had ever since coming to Toronto.

It doesn't really deserve even two and a half stars. Disclaimer, all I ordered and ate was the chicken pad thai. I called in to place my order and the woman who took my order was less than pleasant. She seemed to be in a rush to get off the phone. When I got there to pick up my order, it was almost completely empty. I also asked for an extra fork which was met by a look of disdain. Fine. The final cost was $12.16, which might be pretty steep for a late lunch (~4:45pm), but it would be worth it for delicious pad thai. \nWhen I opened the box, I found white noodles. WHITE NOODLES. I've had my fair share of pad thai, and while I may not be a fan of thai food in general, my favorite food, by far, is pad thai. Anyway, back to the white noodles. When I actually ordered this, I specifically asked for extra sauce. Every time I've ever eaten, or even seen for that matter, pad thai, they always have a rich brownish-(almost) reddish color (given by the tamarind used in traditional pad thai sauce). The first bite I took was lacking in flavor in almost every way, except for a mild sweet background flavor. Every bite after that got a little worse. A few squeezes of lime helped a bit, but it could only do so much. The chicken was entirely inedible. It tasted like chicken. And nothing else. As if they fried the chicken in its own juices and nothing else, not even salt. The egg had the same problem, but, to be fair, I'm not a fan of eggs to begin with. The only thing that makes the dish better than just one star was that the noodle quality was near-perfect. Long noodles go a long way in bettering an eating experience. They also kept their integrity, not falling apart and breaking as soon as you pulled them away from the eating container. That was the ONLY thing that kept this rating from being a one star.\n\nIf you didn't bother reading this entire review, let me just sum it up in one sentence: Go to Thara Thai; way better, cheaper, and bigger portions.

It's cheap here cause the rooms are dated to the 1980s and the managemnet doesn't care about their guests! My wife and I chose to stay here being a MGM resort chain and thought it would be a great experience. BIG MISTAKE! To start off we checked in at the front desk and the gal at the desk told us they overbooked and gave our room to someone else. They were forced to upgrade us to a suite since they already charged our credit card! Hotel policy to charge you for 1 day if you don't cancel within a few days before check in. Reservations were made online a few months earlier. We said wow ok thanks. The next day when we came back to our room around 7:00 pm the room keys didn't work and we paid to go to a show which started in an hour! So we had to go back to the front desk and wait in line for them the reprogram our room keys. The front desk apologized and told us they have rooms now and we must move to another room. We told them we paid for a show that started in an hour and we still needed to get ready. This took 30 minutes at the front desk which left us scrambling to make the show on-time. When we came back from the show our keys didn't work again! So at 12 midnight we had to go back down to the front desk and ask them to reprogram our keys. They proceeded to make keys to our new room and also tell us security would have to meet us at the suite to let us in! Really, all our personal belongings are in the room and now we have to meet security up there to get into the room we paid for?! I felt I did something wrong or a criminal at that point. The room they moved us to was at the end of the hall furthest from the elevators in a different tower and we didn't even have a view. To make matters worse, the maids quarters were located across of our new room and everytime the maids doors slammed, our room door would rattle at all hours of the night. This happened anytime from 10 pm till the morning. I will not be gambling at any MGM resort hotels while I'm here and will not stay in any of these hotels when I come back at the end of the year. I guess they make lots of money so customer service is lacking unless you're a high roller! Do yourself a favor and don't stay at these hotels unless your a gambler and they want your money. Sad these big hotels treat their paying guests like second rate citizens. You would think since they screwed up and sold our paid room they would've at least allowed us to stay in the room they gave us on day 1 and wouldn't inconvenience us with having to move rooms in the middle of our stay. Funny how our room key to our new room worked for the rest of the stay.  I wish I could give them zero stars because that's how I feel my wife and I were treated.", "date": "2017-03-09", "cool": 1, "user_id": "xhoBAfZ464mk2-mA7HIGmg", "business_id": "o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w", "stars": 1}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "hzjAfdfpi-zZUdZrbU2H8w", "text": "Closed! :( Same ownership at Yellowrose or Ellwoods!", "date": "2012-11-18", "cool": 0, "user_id": "UxO2IrQhCBn6rNK90kHUfA", "business_id": "N9jmzeBT-6vQxbpC9yl8Aw", "stars": 5}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "RHeli7DwPmoVl1hdW133zQ", "text": "So good.

I got the tasting menu.  \n\n- Market oyster.  I think they said it was a kumamoto, but I'm not entirely sure.  It had piquilo pepper, Tabasco sorbet, and aged tequila Mignonette.  It tasted pretty good.  Excellent start for the night.\n\n- Chilled main lobster with a pumpkin flan, smoked apple, and a pecan-brown butter vinaigrette.  The lobster was pretty good.  It was soft and sweet.  Coupled with the flan and smoked apple, it was pretty delicious for the cold appetizer.\n\n- Fois gras brulee.  Way too salty and was borderline difficult to eat\n\n- Pan roasted sea scallop with jamon iberico, chopped romesco, and a creamy cauliflower sauce.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and were very tender.  Coupled with the different ingredients, you basically tasted scallop with some sweet kick to it.  So far, this was my favorite even though it wasn't that memorable.\n\n- Herb crusted lamb saddle with roasted sweetbreads, Thomcord grape, and Chanterelle mushroom.  The lamb was pretty good with the herb crust on top.  It was cooked rare, so the meat was soft and very tender.\n\n- 48 hour beef belly with caraway spiced heirloom squash and roasted quince.  If you've ever had braised beef in some type of reduction sauce, this is basically it with one exception.  The beef belly was VERY heavy in fat and flavor.  What I mean by this is that it's literally like eating a spoonful of roasted bone marrow with some strands of meat in it.  The beef belly was very tender, but it was just extremely fatty and rich.\n\n- Green apple mousse with peanut butter cream, celery leaf, and autumn spice.  The green apple mousse reminded me of almond tofu in some ways.  I didn't really taste the green apple flavor that much for some reason.  There were some marshmallows that have been singed to the plate.  The peanut butter cream was a decent complement to the mousse though, but I found the celery leaves added absolutely nothing to the taste other than making the plate look nice.  The peanut butter cream was very powerful and was similar to eating caramel just with peanut flavors.  The long stick is some type of candy that cracks like a hollowed thin candy cane.  This dessert was just ok.\n\nOut of everything I've had, I'd have to say my favorites were probably the pan roasted sea scallop and the herb crusted lamb saddle.  The fois gras brulee and 48 hour beef belly was slightly too rich for me for a 6 course meal.

Which is why I panicked when seeing the tablet-like computer next to my bed....but it wound up that even someone like me could learn how to use it.

The toilet has it's own \"room\" within the bathroom with a door and comes in handy if you don't want to offend anyone who is with you :) \n\nThe sports betting room may be on the small side, but I found it brought more of a \"coziness\" when watching the NBA playoff games as the place was packed. The guys placing your bets are all very friendly and didn't offend any newbie sports with odds questions.

There is no instructions from the staff to what to do - no signs, either.  So, don't expect a greeter.  I think there should be one, though!  In any case, Thank goodness for reading the reviews here on yelp - so, I told my family just pick a table and start filling your plate.   For water there is a water cooler and ice bucket with plastic cups off to the corner.  If you want regular drinks, ask the busboy that comes around cleaning the tables.  \n\nThe restaurant is pretty clean - we noticed that it took a bit for the bus boy to clean the tables from previous customers.  Otherwise,  the dining area is relatively clean AND the buffet area is VERy VERY clean.  There are signs throughout the buffet area starting from the plate sections of the health rules:  basically, do not come up to buffet table with your used plates.  Must get new plates and bowls.  I was relieved that they at least had these signs.  \n\nThey have large plates (for starches) and small bowls to put your other entrees - initially, we just piled it on our plates.  Only, when we saw what other new customers were doing on loading their plates:  large plates for starches and small bowls for other foods.  Theres no rules But I thought I would mention it here.  :)\n\nThe food was pretty good - a large variety.  I guess you never know what will be served.  We all enjoyed it.  We especially loved the pancit.  Very simple yet yummy.  We all tried everything.  It was all good and tasty Filipino dishes.  I liked the fried smelt - or, dilis.  so - good!  My aunt liked the beef stew (Nilagang baka).   The dinuguan was good - no grit.  There was a lot to choose from!\n\nHowever, the dessert is priced separately.  We didn't try any of it but the turon and cascaron looked yum.  I  noticed a customer got some and looked happy eating it.  \n\nIn the back of the restaurant - there is a little grocery area where you can buy ingredients for a meal or buy crackers and candies from the Phillipines like polvoron.  So, check out the back for more.\n\nMy only real negative was that the air conditioned was not on full.  It felt humid in there.  Outside was literally 113 degrees and we had hoped to cool in a restaurant but we were disappointed.  It was not cool at all!!   They were stingy on the air-conditioning!  The staff behind the buffet didn't smile at all.  We didn't feel welcomed.  Even when we paid, there was no smile.  We were 4 filipino women just wanting to eat - nothing strange about us.

This is true with Spring Mountain Road, as there's Sora Ramen and Monta just up the street.  Then, Hiromaru Fusion ramen opens a few months ago.  It's important that when you are going to Hiromaru, that you understand that it is a \"fusion\" restaurant, not a typical Japanese ramen restaurant.\n\nThe location is very good, centrally located on the end-cap in the center.  One feature that I did not personally like was the \"hyper-lighting\" that was installed with the contemporary design.  You almost need sunglasses to enter, especially when you are entering in the evening.  But, the design elements are excellent, with colors of vanilla and Asian red.  There definitely was no short cuts taken with Hiromaru,  Unlike the disappointing design with Monta, you will be pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail at Hiromaru. \n\nThe food and service were fine, especially for a restaurant that is so young in terms of age.  The ramen was good, as well as the service.  Their price points were excellent.  The important thing to always remember with any restaurant is this question:  Would you return for the food?  Our answer would be yes, especially since you have pretty good features already, which include good food, service and atmosphere.\n\nThe restaurant manager was nice enough to come by our table.  I explained to him the lighting issue and contemporary ottoman style seating.  The manager listened intently and took mental notes.  For the lighting issue, he explained that they were going to switch to the Japanese style lighting, which incorporates rice paper shades.  The ottoman style seating is a bit difficult to move, especially for younger people or women wearing dresses.  There are no back rests to these chairs and you are left struggling with how to move them.  The manager quickly noted that they were looking into \"sliders\", which would be placed under each leg that would make sliding the chairs much easier.\n\nUltimately, Hiromaru ramen will be successful.  They have an excellent opportunity to be a player in the ramen market in Las Vegas.  The important thing is that they are willing to listen to their diners, which can't be said about too many Japanese restaurants!  Hopefully, they'll have the lighting and seating issue resolved for our next visit.  In the meantime, keep in mind when you first enter that this will not be typical of most ramen houses, and that you'll be in a very contemporary one as well.

I had the New York strip at $56, which in Vegas is not that bad.  It was good size as well.  The problem was that I ordered medium and the steak was definitely medium rare.  Now I didn't send it back because I can eat medium rare and the steak was good, not great.  With the steak, I ordered the risotto and the onion rings.  Got to admit, probably the best onion rings I've had.  Risotto was good too, maybe a little too much garlic.  I will probably give it another shot and give the chef another crack at cooking my steak how I want it since everything else was really good.  But with so many other steakhouses in the valley, probably be best if they knew how long to keep the steak on the grill.  Just a note, the couple next to us sent back one of their steaks because it wasn't cooked enough.  Maybe order medium well to get a true medium?

I purchased a certified used Tacoma from Right Toyota in October. Before purchasing I pointed out the condition of the windshield which had 3 starred cracks and was pepper sprayed with dozens of small chips making it difficult to see when the sun hits it right. After asking about it I was informed that this would be replaced. Unfortunately, when signing their \"we owe\" sheet this was forgotten however I brought it up during the financing process and I was informed by my salesman that it would be taken care of. Post purchase I come back and since it wasn't in writing the sales manager said \"it wasn't in the original deal\" and they won't be fixing it. I'm surprised that a dealership of such \"prestige\" could even sell a vehicle with a windshield in this shape due to safety concerns, let alone a Toyota certified vehicle.\n\nOriginally I decided I'd finance through Toyota Financial Services (TFS), that was until the finance manager told me the rate would be well over 2% of what competing banks could offer after running my credit (my credit score is above average)! I pushed back and he told me about a local credit union Desert Schools and their competitive rates. I had him run my credit through them and the approved rate was on par with the rest of the market. I was under the impression at this point that my loan would be through Desert Schools, after all why run my credit through them? Instead I received paperwork from TFS for my auto loan and now I have 3 credit inquiries on my credit report (2 from Toyota and 1 from Desert Schools). It seems like they were just trying to make more money off of the deal by gouging me with high finance rates if they could've met the market rates to begin with. To top this off the finance manager was rude, inconsiderate and I felt like I was being rushed to get the process over with.\n\nOverall poor sales experience, poor financing experience and poor post-sales customer service.

I've continued to come back mostly because the location is close to my home.  This morning, I left there feeling very frustrated, and I will not return. \n\nMy sister is visiting from out of town and asked that we find a yoga class to go to together.  Saturday mornings have consistently been advertised as the $5 community class at Yoga Hive.  I checked the schedule online to be sure that the class was not canceled due to the holiday season.  I observed that it was not canceled but that there was a sub (Kimberly, the owner).  \n\nWhen we showed up this morning, as is often the case, the entry way was terribly crowded, and we had to wait outside in the elements as people inside took their time making space for others.  From the entrance, I could hear the owner chatting loudly.  This is not the kind of intentional calm and mindfulness that I would expect from a yoga studio.  When my sister approached Kimberly and let her know that it was her first time there, unlike her chatty rapport with the people she seemed to know, she did not welcome her, but asked her to stand to the side.  We then realized that the class was $14 (the regular admission) because there was a substitute instructor.  For a studio that is located in the quickly gentrifying Garfield neighbor, I feel that the very least that could be done to cater to the \"community\" is to offer a weekly $5 class.  If there is a change in that price, it should be stated loudly and clearly on the website.

There were only a few open tables, and we were promptly seated. We ordered the whitefish salad appetizer and it was GREAT. I haven't had smoked whitefish salad like this since I lived in Chicago.

My regular reservation is at the West Wing at the MGM, but I decided on this trip to do it up and go for a lake view room at the former reigning king of the high-class set, The Bellagio Hotel.\n\nThe hotel is nice, I'll give it that.  The lobby is open and the conservatory is bright and interestingly conceived.  There are terrific shops and world-class restaurants.  The dealers are all very friendly and helpful when you get confused about the details of whatever sucker bet you are extending.  I also like the scale of the place... it's big enough to seem spectacular, but not unmanageably so, like, say, Caesar's Palace next-door.\n\nThere is an interesting trade-off I have noticed regarding the accommodations, though.  On one trip I stayed in the spa tower.  Nice room, lousy view.  Twin sinks.  Lots of marble.  DVD player.  On this trip, though, I was in the main tower overlooking the fountains and though I was already paying more for that privilege, I noticed that the room wasn't as nicely appointed as the spa tower room, and was definitely much smaller.  Not just that, but it seemed, and I might be nitpicking here, that the window in my view room might have been a little wider.   It wasn't like looking out a porthole, but it felt like it wasn't far from it.  I definitely enjoyed several helpings of the famous Bellagio Fountains display from the comfort of my room, but I was expecting a view that was a little more panoramic.\n\nI think in the future I will stick with the West Wing.

And where exactly do these people relax after a day of walking those endless casino-miles?  Where do they get ready to go out for the night?  Where indeed do they get their freak on?\n\nThe prevailing wisdom asserts that the hotel room is the LEAST critical measure of enjoyment as pertains to the successful Vegas getaway.  I am here to disabuse you of any notion that the party-line is worth your penitent regard.  From where I sit your hotel room is by far the MOST important decision you will make when plotting your Sin-City sojourn.\n\nEasy for me to say, of course, because from where I sit is in my room at the Mandarin Oriental hotel.\n\nLocated on the periphery of City Center, right on the strip, the MOLV is your quiet and civilized oasis.  Calm.  Serene.  Tranquil.  Beautiful.  \n\nExpensive.\n\nYeah it costs more than a few extra dollars to stay here, so if you're hoarding your readies to flay the stickmen at the craps table then perhaps the IP is a better option.  But to my mind, that money is far better-spent on the tasteful luxury and warm, welcoming atmosphere afforded to the lucky traveler who rests his head here.  You will want for nothing.  You will not spend 40 minutes checking in.  You will not have to navigate a crowded and smoky casino to access your room.\n\nI admit it.  The Mandarin has spoiled me for every other hotel on the strip.  Even options I had considered \"a step up\" in the past now seem hopelessly dreary.  But on a recent visit the tariff for my room was only 20 bucks more a night than what was surely a cramped shoebox at the sprawling and cacophonous MGM Grand.\n\nAnother perk...  after inquiring of the doorman how far a walk it was to the Cosmopolitan he responded with an estimate of 5-10 minutes or so, but if i could wait 5 minutes the house car would be available to drive me to my destination.  Hmmm.... walk or be driven there in the back of a chauffeured Mercedes.  Yeah, not such a tough call, there.\n\nSo look. You can take your chances at mandalayexcaliburcircuscircuswynnmiragepalacestationpolotowersballagio or wherever else the hoi-freaking-polloi is congregating.

At an Italian spot it might be Pizza Margherita or Veal Parmigiana, For French food it might be Moules Frites or the Torchon of Foie Gras.  It's the dish that, if prepared properly, signals that the cuisine is up to par.  When trying to ascertain whether the full range of offerings is worth exploring it must first be determined that the kitchen can get the basics right.\n\nMy benchmark dish for any Thai restaurant is Tom Kha Kai, a magical combination of chicken, chicken broth, coconut cream, galanga, fish sauce, mushrooms, lime juice, and chili oil.  Ingredients may vary from spot to spot, as they often will, but the overall composition is pretty consistent.  The rub, as I have experienced it, is in getting the balance right.  Some places have too much coconut cream, others offer just a hint of chili oil (or omit it completely.)  I've had it with all kinds of mushrooms, and sometimes with huge chunks of galanga, and sometimes with none at all.  For one as obsessed as I, it grows a little tiresome.\n\nI have had Tom Kha Kai at countless restaurants in the Southland, and am still looking for one that is as perfectly put together as what they serve at Lotus of Siam, the celebrated industrial park oddity way off the strip in Las Vegas.  Everything is in perfect balance and when I that first spoonful slides down my gullet I almost tear up a little.  Seriously.  It's just that feeling one encounters when something is SO right.. there's a magic to it.\n\nThe rest of the menu can be a little hit-or-miss, as others have noted.  But there is so much on the menu that is off-the-charts terrific that it hardly seems to merit de-starring.\n\nSo five stars for the crispy duck with spicy mint leaves.  Five stars for the Nam Kao Todd, crispy rice with minced sour sausage.  Five stars for the spicy beef salad.  So what if the Panag curry is a little lifeless?  There is certainly no shortage of items on this menu that make my head spin with delight.\n\nAnd no, the decor is nothing to write home about.  I couldn't care less because the service is always so friendly and accommodating.  My blinders go on at Lotus and when I have an array of tasty treats in front of me I can't even SEE the decor.  Love really is blind, I guess.\n\nAnd eleventy-billion stars for the wine list.  Jeez LOUISE the wine list.  Nothing, NOTHING goes better with spicy Thai cuisine than a cold bottle of Reisling and Lotus of Siam has scads of them.  Rare and highly rated selections at rock-bottom prices.  Donhoff.  J.J. Prum.  Zind-Humbrecht.  All the heavy hitters are represented, and there are plenty of Goldkapsels at near-release prices. Achtung! A perfect match for every dish can be found here along with a staff that can guide you through the polysyllabic minefield that one encounters with all things Germanic.\n\nStay away from the buffet.  Make a point of ordering some Northern dishes.  ABSOLUTELY order a bowl of the Tom Kha.  When visiting at night be sure to make a reservation and DEFINITELY arrange with your cab driver to pick you up after your meal because the parking lot gets a little bit sketchy after dark.  But for me, no trip to Vegas is complete without a visit to Lotus.

We did not have reservations but read good reviews on Yelp so we thought we'd give it a try.  We opted for the 6 course Prix Fixe meal for $65.  At least one option in each course had a $15 addition if you chose that selection...which of course is inevitable since you want to eat the best thing. So not too sure if I like that type of sell tactic but even so, the food was fantastic. All the dishes were delicious, some more innovative and original than others.  The turbot was an upsell and the servers were really pushing for that one.  Practically everyone in the dining room was ordering it.  Honestly, after having a few bites, I was a bit disappointed.  It was cooked well, the consistency was good, soft, not chewy.  But it just lacked any flavor.  I'm all about mild fish but this one was just too mild.  I ended up liking my husband's salmon more than mine which is hilarious because I don't even order salmon at restaurants.  At least the salmon was cooked well and was paired with a deliciously mild green sauce. The hot and cold Foie Gras was by far one of the best dishes of the night.  The \"cold foie gras was paired with uni (sea urchin).  So it was like butteriness on top of more creamy butteriness.  mmmmmmm....heaven.  The hot foie gras was laid on what i could best describe as a piece of savory mini rice crispy cakes, Asian style.  The buttery soft and the salty crispy just went so well together.  We ate so much food to describe everything but I have to mention the deserts.  The irish car bomb was genius! From the plating to the ingredients used to the flavors.....perfect! The thing that topped it all off for me were the pop rocks used to simulate the carbonation of the car bomb.  WOW.  My desert was the citrus canelloni and that was superb too, mild, smooth, delicious.  And last but not least ........the vase that was a centerpiece at the beginning of our meal, then changes into a carafe holding a liquid that they come a pour after about the 2nd course of our meal, and just sits there for the entire rest of your meal.  Now as your are enjoying your deserts, a server comes over carrying a metal kettle and proceeds to pour liquid nitrogen into the carafe.  A few more minutes of waiting and voila, you get home made ice tea with mint, lemon grass, orange peel and a teeny bit of sugar.  I am so trying this last part at home!

All it took was the words \"Churrasqueira\" on the sign to convince me to step inside and abandon my plans of going to the gym. I'd never heard of a Churrasqueira before, but it sounded kinda like \"Carniceria,\" which always means good food.\n\nI parked my bike in front of a be-toqued hobo and crossed the threshold. This place is the real deal. Boisterous olive skinned people (the Portugese?) conversed loudly with each other across piles of chicken and glasses of red wine. A baba-from-the-old-country-looking lady sat in a corner, monologuing to a group men standing around in jackets and scarves. Everyone seemed like they belonged here, like they either worked for the place or were related to someone who did. Some hilarious over-the-top foreign soap opera played in the corner, unwatched.\n\nAbout the time when I was starting to feel out of place, this sweet girl behind the counter grabbed my attention and set me at ease with a good old \"hi there, let me know if you have any questions!\" I ended up ordering the half chicken special, the words leaving my mouth slow and gummy due to the fact that my lips were still frozen. I'd hoped I made a good first impression, because this girl became my rock. Within two minutes of stepping into this place I felt like I had been dropped into another country and I was gonna need a friend.\n\nInitially, I had planned to grab the food and go, but the ambience was so pleasant that I decided to stay, even if that meant eating dinner in a restaurant by myself while being scrutinized by locals. I pulled out this new neuroscience book that I'd been hoping to read and got to work on it; waitress girl brought out some bread and butter. Ahhhh yeaa, I was gonna make of night of this.\n\nBefore I knew it, the chicken dinner arrived. The thing was huge, one of those classic big Italian dinner plates piled high with salad, spherical potatoes, chicken, and dipping sauce. It was truly the biggest pile of food I'd ever seen at a restaurant in Toronto.\n\nThe chicken was fantastic. Rubbed with salt and some interesting combination of spices. It was totally worth breaking this week-long vegetarian streak I'd been on. The potatos, too, were remarkable: salty, roasty, and inherently satisfying. However, the best part of the dish was the piri piri sauce. This stuff (which waitress girl later informed me was handmade made in house), had the perfect balance of heat, acidity, and flavor. It also had a fair bit of creaminess that really rounded out the flavor of the potatoes.\n\nAll too soon, the chicken was gone and I was stuffed. I felt truly good. Not even the thought of having to bike through the snow could put a damper on my chicken-fortified spirit. I'd had a good meal, made some progress on this book, and found a cool new place to eat where I felt welcome. I think the waitress even called me cute at the end there.

The outer crust is about 2.5 inches thick (or should I say tall), nice and crispy, the bottom crust is relatively thin and chewy but manages to hold all the ingredients. There's plenty of cheese and all the other toppings tasted fresh. Their sausage is particularly good, having a nice sweet taste of fennel. The sauce has a nice chunky texture and balances sweetness and tanginess pretty well. The pizza is greasy, at least if it has sausage (due to the huge size and amount of toppings) but also very satisfying, believe me if you are hungry and think you can easily eat a normal 14\" pizza, you'll probably only be able to eat half of the 14\" Amore pie.\n\nNote if you order a stuffed pizza to eat in or take out, the pie takes 45 mins to cook.\n\nThe indoors sitting area is decorated with all sorts of pictures and memorabilia from Chicago, overall pretty clean and good service.\n\nIf you want Chicago pizza in Las Vegas, Amore is probably the only real choice (along with Rosati's maybe, and I'd say Pietown but it's closed for now).

Then, I had the beef shank and my husband had the venison special. I was slighly disappointed there were no seafood options on the menu or specials, but I think that was reflective of seasonal and local fresh ingredients being utilized. Although the flavors on both our meat dishes were very similar, they were both delicious. The best part of the dining experience at Osteria Papavero is dessert.

I am not complaining about them having so many specials, because what we tried of them were great. I'm more critical of the fact that the specials were not really documented anywhere, so it was hard to keep track of them.

I do wish there was more of a place to just hangout if you are finishing a drink if you didn't have a table.  But they might just do that so you can buy a table, but at Marquee they have that so I will hold it against them.  The music selection was great for a little bit, then they changed the DJ.  The second DJ wasn't nearly as talented with his transitions or cuts and it sounded like he just turned on pandora or was playing an iTunes playlist.  It wouldn't be that big of a deal, but with so many other DJs in Vegas at clubs \"next door\" it kind of makes you second guess the decision.  Hopefully it's not a common occurrence here.  All in all it was a good time.  It was a great layout and the club is easy to walk into after you valet your car.

They sent out there sales rep Dave to provide a quote for the install. After much research and discussion with airplus including the owner Bill , Airplus made a proposal to install a slant fin boiler and giant water heater. The price was to include removal of the existing and installation of the new boiler and water heater, including all necessary components, piping and venting for around 10k. The warranty was to cover all equipment for 5 years on parts and labour. We made the agreement and installed was completed and certified by a Airplus technician Ever year since i have had issue with the boiler firing up, i would call Airplus for a no heat call and they would dispatch a technician to access This summer I had third party to perform a independent certification on the unit. As i have had continued issues. The boiler and hot water heater was not installed correctly and did not pass certification by the independent third party that is licenced to perform work on a slant fin boilers. Inadequate ventilation was provided to the boiler and water heater. This in turn reduced the reliability, efficiency and put my self and tenants in harm of depleting the oxygen in the area which would cause suffocation/death. The unit should have never been certified from the start. Repairs were made, by myself and the technician which cost me out of my own pocket approx $350 So when i fired up the boiler again it will not start. i contacted Airplus regarding the issue. they told me they could come in couple days. as they only have one boiler technician. The day of the appointment i was contacted saying they would be canceling my appointment as the tech was in the hospital and would not know when he would get out. they also said that they would have to charge a diagnostic change of $175. i told them that i had a five years part and labour warranty through them and emailed their office my documentation. including bill of sale, agreement proposal and emailed conversation from the rep to myself. I was then told the following day that my warranty through them was null and void and that any further work would be charged at $175 per hour.

One quick tip for this particular location: don't rest your beers near the edges of the warped tables, unless you have quick reflexes.\n\nOne of the reasons I frequent Primantis as often as I do is the Penguins and Steelers game specials. Get your wonderfully mediocre IC Lights for as cheaply as they're made. In all honesty though, the specials here are extremely competitive. You can easily get a quality dinner and a few beers during a hockey or football game for around $10 - which is impressive for this city.

We were still living out of state at the time.  We flew in, met Randy and Jerrod, got an estimate, picked our finishes and hired them for the job.  We hired Lollis to tear out all the flooring and install new tile and carpet, cut down our kitchen island to 1 level and extend the size of the counter, paint all cabinets in the house (kitchen, bathrooms and laundry), install window trim and crown molding, install new 5+\" molding in entire house, install new quartz counter tops, do 1 wall of shiplap in the livingroom, build and install barn doors in the livingroom, install all new lighting and ceiling fans throughout the house, install a water filtration system and paint the entire interior of the house (including ceilings).  The entire time the remodel was happening we were still living in CO.  Lollis is extremely trustworthy and we had no issue turning over the keys to our home to them.  They kept in constant contact, sent pictures and updates regularly and checked in with us at each step of the remodel to ensure we were all in the loop on everything happening.  We didn't see the remodeled home until the day we arrived with the moving truck to move in.  I was almost in tears when I saw the home.  The work they did was beyond astonishing.  Everything was absolutely perfect.  To say they are perfectionists is almost an understatement.  Everything they did was above and beyond our expectations.  There was not 1 item in the entire home that we had to have them come fix or redo.  Not one.  It was all done flawlessly.  They made what could have been a nightmare and difficult remodel into a dream come true for us.  They are a pleasure to work with and the most upstanding, skilled and trustworthy company.  After moving in we hired them to do a quick install of a 2nd fence/gate on our property to help keep our dogs from escaping every time someone came by and opened the main fence gate.  We also had them install our doggie door.  All of this was done with superb quality and attention to detail.  Their pricing was very fair and the quality of products was outstanding.

First off from the time I entered the dealership I was treated with something refreshing. RESPECT. I had tried to collect information on a vehicle I was interested in (Evolution GSR) at the other Mitsubishi dealership in town on Barlow Trail a few days prior to making a trip to the guys at Hyatt but no one was willing to speak with me. I felt as though no one was taking me seriously. I had to speak with the receptionist at Platinum before a salesperson decided to walk over to me. I felt as though I was being judged maybe as being too young to possibly afford the vehicle? Upon asking for a test drive I was denied. With the reasoning that there were no demo models currently available even though I could clearly see a few of the vehicles sitting outside, and reschedule when it wasn't so busy? Needlessly to say I left their Dealership and went to Hyatt a few days later. Once in the dealership I was greeted by a nice gentlemen Matthew. He asked me if I was interested in a beverage right off the bat and made me feel very comfortable with the process. His knowledge on the vehicle was very helpful, and his demeanor was very caring. Even before I decided to purchase the vehicle he gave me a tour of the dealership and also an idea of the services available. It was the entire package that made me decide to go with Hyatt, and Mitsubishi in general. I never felt uncomfortable, or pressured into the sale. Everything just felt right. I absolutely LOVE my new car. Thanks Matthew! and Thanks Hyatt! I definitely recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new vehicle!\n\nJonathan", "date": "2012-03-28", "cool": 0, "user_id": "XOdnv458a9LHyvX9bgqCWQ", "business_id": "rPIPLdbwR4IX34atK_eYEw", "stars": 5}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "OUFY1UtSk97T74dOl5pJsg", "text": "I LOVE this restaurant!

They are one of the only salons to carry Jenny Packham in the region, and I personally found Powder to have shoddy customer service- so i went to White!\n\nMy consultant was Tamara and I worked with her for every appointment I had. She was very personable, honest, and helpful. I didn't always bring bridesmaids or family, and she truly felt like a friend when I was alone.\n\nI ended up buying with Jenny Packham's Joy. When you buy a dress you get champagne and other goodies. I received so many compliments on my wedding dress- it was the talk of the night. Everyone kept commenting on how glamorous and unique it was. Not the strapless a-line or fit-n-flare everyone and their sister wears.\n\nThe dress arrived very quickly, and they let me know as soon as it arrived. I also had alterations done at White Toronto. Given the amount of beading on my dress, I figured they'd know how to alter it best. The seamstress did an outstanding job. She picked up on all my little body eccentricities without me having to mention them, and altered it flawlessly.\n\nWhite Toronto further has anything a bride needs. I needed a backless adhesive bra and couldn't find the gel version anywhere in the city. They had it and even showed me how to put it on properly. they also sell crazy things like covers for stilettos so your heel won't sink into the ground if you walk on grass and seamless undies.\n\nFinally, they did a wonderful job packaging my dress. They did so such that my dress had no wrinkles the day of. They also helped me get my dress in my coupe- which is no easy feat.\n\nOverall, I couldn't have asked for a better wedding dress experience. This is one bridal salon you have to go to.", "date": "2013-06-02", "cool": 0, "user_id": "-TRN3qRQuT2vtyuuWvEv2w", "business_id": "Yr03NzsQVVtVphdQVcclkQ", "stars": 5}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "A-k97KPQci1SEiu_BPKoww", "text": "Altered Ego is a awesome salon, you really get top quality salon looks without having to pay top quality salon prices.

In fact, I've never seen any of these things here. If you're looking for a more ambient pub experience (which I like) I would go anytime time between opening and 7pm.

I've tried a plethora of things from their cod sliders, flat breads (it's essentially pizza) burgers, fish and chips, Shepherd's Pie and many others. I have not been disappointed with anything here. Their drink selection is what you will find in any Hibernian pub, and they poor the best pint of Guinness (properly poured, clean lines, and ACTUALLY in a Guinness glass) I have found out of the many pubs in the phoenix area.  They offer wide range of Draught Irish beers, and have rotating tap of local  & nationwide craft breweries, as well as an extensive bar with a plethora of Irish and Scottish Whiskies. They even serve Kilkenny Cream Ale, which is hard to find in most places around the states. I would suppose the only downside on the food is their dessert.

First of all, they do not have a brick oven, they use a conveyor therefore it comes out quite similar to a Dominos pizza. The sauce had a decent flavor, but there was SO MUCH. Luckily I got jalape\u00f1os on my pizza so that helped a bit with the taste. I also got pepperonis and ham, and on my entire 10\" pizza there were only 8 pepperonis (2 per slice) and to me that seems pretty skimpy. There was even less ham. So overall, decent crust, way too much sauce, and not nearly enough toppings. You can save yourself some money and get pizza from a franchise place, it will taste the same (if not a little better).", "date": "2016-03-29", "cool": 0, "user_id": "gFS744rq4r8cAccnqkBTtw", "business_id": "hqWNpbCEzt7EzUeWkDqjBA", "stars": 2}, {"useful": 0, "funny": 0, "review_id": "Sr6t29_J3Vue_THSm6CGsg", "text": "Authentic, but I wasn't that impressed.

We ordered a dining table, six chairs, and a server.  First of all, let me say that Michael was my sales rep and he was nothing short of 5 Stars.  Professional, personable, good communication.  My complaint with Ashley is that they took 3 months to deliver the table and six chairs, when they originally told us it would arrive in about 5 to 6 weeks.  The server is still not here.  The furniture is the same quality as what we saw in the store.  The delivery team kept us informed on an hour by hour basis of their arrival and assembles pieces quickly on the spot.  I would say Ashley occupies a purchase point that is better quality than some warehouse furniture and below Thomasville and that ilk.  If the furniture arrived on time, my rating would definitely be 4 stars.", "date": "2017-02-26", "cool": 0, "user_id": "q-jBUKa4y4UrLDc09pYj8w", "business_id": "D9J1Ihmz7wAWUpRJ0QIn2Q", "stars": 3}, {"useful": 2, "funny": 0, "review_id": "6zQx9JiodkVEWz6euWCT9g", "text": "I ordered a dining room table, four side chairs, two arm chairs, and a buffet -- total cost about $6,000.  They had the table and four arm chairs in stock.  They did not have an arm chair in stock.  A comfortable arm chair is most important to me.  Since the store did not have any of the arm chairs in stock, I tried other arm chairs from a different line.  I was not impressed by what they had in stock.  I was told by the salesperson  that what I was ordering was superior and that if I did not like it when it was delivered that they \"would make it right\" and that I could return everything. \n\nA few weeks later, even though I had not taken possession of the  furniture, I asked to take a side chair home to demo it, both for looks and comfort.  Two hours in the chair convinced me that these chairs were not for me.  \n\nThe next day, we returned the chair to the store and told them we did not want the set.  Remind you, none of this furniture had come in, none of it was delivered, it was not a custom set.  It was from stock at their warehouse in Los Angeles.  They charged me a restocking fee of close to $600.  No amount of appeal or appeasement would change their minds.\nI will never do business with Bassett again.
