The sandwich consists of a HUGE tenderized chicken breast, thick cut pieces of bacon, cheddar cheese, veggies, and a fresh lemon herb aioli. The lemon aioli was a suprise but it helped to add a dash of tartness to balance out the rich fried chicken. The portion of this sandwich is extremely large and I had  to share the last bit with my hubby. Pair it with either their truffle or sweet potato fries and you have got a winner!!!! As far as the restaurant goes the employees go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your meal.

On those two occasions I received pleasant and timely service so my complaints are exclusively with the food.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I were busy in Oakland, feeling hungry, tired, and not particularly adventurous food-wise, and this place seemed like an old pair of comfortable shoes. I ordered the Turkey Devonshire since it is hyped on the menu. As soon as it arrived, I could tell I made a bad choice. It looked and tasted bland, dry, and oddly reminiscent of something an aunt brings to a large family function that you eat slowly and begrudgingly out of politeness. Since I was starving I did my best to work it down and chalked it up to bad luck. The pierogies were okay. \n\nOn our second trip I was determined to enjoy myself. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, (with the mistaken conviction that grilled cheese sandwiches are impossible to fuck up) picking caramelized onions and roasted red peppers as my toppings, also substituting my side with a caesar salad. The food arrived promptly, and though the appearance of the food improved, the first bite of the sandwich and \"oh NO, not again!\"  The grilled cheese sandwich was soggy and you couldn't taste the cheese at all because the red peppers and onions (which were neither caramelized nor roasted) were PILED on, giving it a mushy quality that generated some bonafide body shudders. I suppose I share some responsibility in this for my choice of toppings. Maybe it threw them off-balance? I set the sandwich aside and hoped to at least enjoy my salad but quickly discovered that several pieces were thoroughly brown. Dispirited, I spent the rest of my meal concentrating on getting drunk, which was the only grand success of the evening. Again, the pierogies were merely okay.  \n\nMy girlfriend's rating of the food on both occasions was \"meh,\" which is enviable considering how comically unpleasant my experience turned out. While writing this I asked her if she remembered what she had. \"No.\"  That's probably for the best.  \n\nI doubt this is a common occurrence at the Union Grill, which has many positive reviews and seems to be a popular place, but the fates are cruelly intent on keeping me out. Maybe I just had the dumb luck of selecting the two shittiest things on the menu. Maybe all the regulars know not to get grilled cheese with caramelized onions and roasted red peppers or the Turkey Devonshire and the rest of the food is amazing. In any case, I hope you have better luck than I do."}, {"review_id": "DhiRAFM-vZQlLjcWQHuunA", "funny": 0, "stars": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 0, "user_id": "MFoDRss_gXO4J9nNxkxtFw", "business_id": "9o8Zie2MHPwJFOkOsXbqPw", "date": "2014-08-26", "text": "I rented a truck in July for a one-way move.

Also good, but nothing spectacular.  \n\nThird course was sea bass wrapped in potato.  Inventive, but not only dry, but I was served an unacceptable piece of fish, certainly not one that should exist in a restaurant with this price structure.  \n\nFourth course, the supposed turkey which was an approximately 1.5\"x1.5\" square.\nWhen I cut into it there was a huge blood vessel running through the center.  Nice. They also forgot my drizzle of sweet potato.  Additional items including a solitary piece of asparagus that had been bisected, perhaps a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, and a rolled up item I was told was a combination of dark meat and stuffing that was an measured perhaps 3/4 of an ounce.  When I told the staff of the issue with the meat requesting a new plate with a normal sized portion of turkey, sweet potatoes and asparagus guess what I got?  The same tiny portions, but at least this time the turkey was edible.  \n\nThe only real stand out for this meal was the last course which was a chocolate dome with hazelnut praline and icecream inside.  Hot chocolate was poured over the top to melt into the top of the dome.  Inventive and delicious.  \n\nThis will definitely be marked as the one Thanksgiving I had where I wasn't stuffed."}]

The food is okay. The bowls are not to big but it is over priced for the amount you get. They do have good specials but I don't reccomended this place as the best Ramen in charlotte. There's better, believe me! But it is somewhere you should experience at least once. As far as the pork belly buns, they are okay not to much flavor. It only comes with 2 for the price of a whole bowl of ramen. So still not the best."}, {"review_id": "pZk8UdYyOdK3LjSr2unTOw", "funny": 1, "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "cool": 1, "user_id": "UnM2K5ru0agPbDNnTAlQww", "business_id": "AN9sX6Dh8-QAoJssdyno8A", "date": "2016-02-10", "text": "THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD YOU WILL EVER EAT!!
