The sausage was very flavorful as well and we highly recommend the pepperoni and sausage pie if you like meat. We liked the pizza so much we got a second one to take home.

The sandwich consists of a HUGE tenderized chicken breast, thick cut pieces of bacon, cheddar cheese, veggies, and a fresh lemon herb aioli. The lemon aioli was a suprise but it helped to add a dash of tartness to balance out the rich fried chicken. The portion of this sandwich is extremely large and I had  to share the last bit with my hubby. Pair it with either their truffle or sweet potato fries and you have got a winner!!!! As far as the restaurant goes the employees go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your meal. One time my husband's burger was over done and they quickly prepared him a new one and comped an extra side for him.

Another plus is that there are walk ways and a tram to 3 other hotel/casinos, which as you know if you've been to Vegas, is a heaven send limiting your time in the dry desert heat. \nExcalibur has a variety of good eats, slots, shops, tables and entertainment.

Granted this place is packed on the weekends and to keep pace with the knashing carnivors waiting anxiously to get in and get there feed on, the staff in nasty pajamas has to be on point with the kitchen.  This seems obvious right?  Well on Sunday there was a line out the door, normal, and the experience started like this:\n\nThe hostess, a girl I had not seen before and unfortunately did not get her name, asked us how many and told us that there would be a 15-20 min wait.  So I looked to the Bar which no one was at and asked if we could sit there.  First she eye rolled me and then said I don't know.  I asked if she could check and again the same exasperated eye roll that she might have fallen backwards from, \"Ill check,\" she said.  I waited 5 min while she talked to severs, played with her pen and gave the general I could give a rats hind end about you as a customer look and finally I asked if she even asked any one (of which she didn't because I was watching like a hawk with a caged animal in my stomache ready to leap from its depths and attack on site).  Also, I wasnt the only annoyed one as all the people were talking about how rude that hostess was.  She is definately not the face any owner would want at the FOH.  Lazy, non-caring, and rude.\n\nWhile sitting waiting for Griselda the Mean to get back to me, I looked around and there were 6-8 four tops sitting with dirty dishes on them which would have acomodated most of the people outside waiting.  Those table stayed dirty for exactly 15 min before they started to be cleared.  This whole team led by there Manager Jessica, who didn't lift a finger to help any one and simply walked around with a face that could sink a1000 ships and then complained about the customers attitudes only a few feet from me.  Maybe its just me but the Manager should be the buisiest person in the restaurant, cleaning making sure that customers are taken care of, smiling, greeting, not hiding in corners and avoiding the crazy crowd that had acumulated outside the door.  Jessica only became interested in us when we asked for a comment card.  Then she couldn't stop walking behind me and my girlfriend looming over to get a peek at what was being written.  So unprofessional.  She was training...if you want to call it that, a server by the name of Cali for management, who was AWESOME.  She was sooooo weeded and still she took the time to come by and make sure that we were ok at least 3 times.  Great job on the floor Cali, hopefully you will be replacing Jessica so very soon!!\n\nFood...well it was satisfactory this time.  My steak came out mooing at me, way rare (I ordered medium), and the hashbrowns were raw and I think if I equated it to a measuring cup I got a bout 1/3 of a cup of hashbrowns and the eggs over easy were dripping with oil, saturating everything on the plate.  The open air kitchen was getting slammed, plates were being thrown on the floor by the line cooks, (Seriously?) the cooks were openly swearing at the servers and calling them horrible names behind the line only 2 feet from me and I was able to hear everything.  Sloppy plating and the list goes on.  My girlfriend said here omlet was good but the pot of bread she ordered was raw about an inch down in the cup.\n\nSorry Rise and Shine, normally you all are so on point and friendly and look so comfy in your designer flannel pajamas.

On those two occasions I received pleasant and timely service so my complaints are exclusively with the food.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I were busy in Oakland, feeling hungry, tired, and not particularly adventurous food-wise, and this place seemed like an old pair of comfortable shoes. I ordered the Turkey Devonshire since it is hyped on the menu. As soon as it arrived, I could tell I made a bad choice. It looked and tasted bland, dry, and oddly reminiscent of something an aunt brings to a large family function that you eat slowly and begrudgingly out of politeness. Since I was starving I did my best to work it down and chalked it up to bad luck. The pierogies were okay. \n\nOn our second trip I was determined to enjoy myself. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, (with the mistaken conviction that grilled cheese sandwiches are impossible to fuck up) picking caramelized onions and roasted red peppers as my toppings, also substituting my side with a caesar salad. The food arrived promptly, and though the appearance of the food improved, the first bite of the sandwich and \"oh NO, not again!\"  The grilled cheese sandwich was soggy and you couldn't taste the cheese at all because the red peppers and onions (which were neither caramelized nor roasted) were PILED on, giving it a mushy quality that generated some bonafide body shudders. I suppose I share some responsibility in this for my choice of toppings. Maybe it threw them off-balance? I set the sandwich aside and hoped to at least enjoy my salad but quickly discovered that several pieces were thoroughly brown. Dispirited, I spent the rest of my meal concentrating on getting drunk, which was the only grand success of the evening. Again, the pierogies were merely okay.  \n\nMy girlfriend's rating of the food on both occasions was \"meh,\" which is enviable considering how comically unpleasant my experience turned out. While writing this I asked her if she remembered what she had. \"No.\"  That's probably for the best.  \n\nI doubt this is a common occurrence at the Union Grill, which has many positive reviews and seems to be a popular place, but the fates are cruelly intent on keeping me out. Maybe I just had the dumb luck of selecting the two shittiest things on the menu. Maybe all the regulars know not to get grilled cheese with caramelized onions and roasted red peppers or the Turkey Devonshire and the rest of the food is amazing. In any case, I hope you have better luck than I do."}, {"review_id": "kDd2yjIUxRtgkuXdw0MCEg", "funny": 3, "stars": 2, "useful": 4, "cool": 2, "user_id": "T5MJ20E14ZnYqsZporHEQw", "business_id": "rtlsfmdufArhk-47sWIf2w", "date": "2013-11-29", "text": "Wow, what a disappointment.\n\nMy family and I went for Thanksgiving.  The menu was set at $145 for a set five courses meaning that each course was averaging $29.  \n\nThe first course was a lobster salad which was decent, but nothing to write home about.  \n\nThe second course was 1.5-2oz of parmesan risotto.  Also good, but nothing spectacular.  \n\nThird course was sea bass wrapped in potato.  Inventive, but not only dry, but I was served an unacceptable piece of fish, certainly not one that should exist in a restaurant with this price structure.  \n\nFourth course, the supposed turkey which was an approximately 1.5\"x1.5\" square.\nWhen I cut into it there was a huge blood vessel running through the center.  Nice. They also forgot my drizzle of sweet potato.  Additional items including a solitary piece of asparagus that had been bisected, perhaps a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, and a rolled up item I was told was a combination of dark meat and stuffing that was an measured perhaps 3/4 of an ounce.  When I told the staff of the issue with the meat requesting a new plate with a normal sized portion of turkey, sweet potatoes and asparagus guess what I got?  The same tiny portions, but at least this time the turkey was edible.  \n\nThe only real stand out for this meal was the last course which was a chocolate dome with hazelnut praline and icecream inside.  Hot chocolate was poured over the top to melt into the top of the dome.  Inventive and delicious.  \n\nThis will definitely be marked as the one Thanksgiving I had where I wasn't stuffed."}]

The food is okay. The bowls are not to big but it is over priced for the amount you get. They do have good specials but I don't reccomended this place as the best Ramen in charlotte. There's better, believe me! But it is somewhere you should experience at least once. As far as the pork belly buns, they are okay not to much flavor. It only comes with 2 for the price of a whole bowl of ramen. So still not the best."}, {"review_id": "pZk8UdYyOdK3LjSr2unTOw", "funny": 1, "stars": 5, "useful": 1, "cool": 1, "user_id": "UnM2K5ru0agPbDNnTAlQww", "business_id": "AN9sX6Dh8-QAoJssdyno8A", "date": "2016-02-10", "text": "THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD YOU WILL EVER EAT!!
