The crust is perfect although very thin in the middle so if you like thick crust this may not be for you. The sausage was very flavorful as well and we highly recommend the pepperoni and sausage pie if you like meat. We liked the pizza so much we got a second one to take home. As for the rest...the atmosphere is cozy and romantic, the perfect place for a special occasion. We also tried the meatballs which were delicious with another delicious marinara sauce.

When ever I am craving a juicy burger and fries I come to this place. While this place has a \"healthy\" and a \"happy side\" I always stick to the happy side because well ...YOLO!!! So far I have had the classic burger, the cherry poper burger, the chix on broadway sandwich, and the hot chix salad. Out of all of these my favorite has been the chix on broadway sandwich. The sandwich consists of a HUGE tenderized chicken breast, thick cut pieces of bacon, cheddar cheese, veggies, and a fresh lemon herb aioli. The lemon aioli was a suprise but it helped to add a dash of tartness to balance out the rich fried chicken. The portion of this sandwich is extremely large and I had  to share the last bit with my hubby. Pair it with either their truffle or sweet potato fries and you have got a winner!!!! As far as the restaurant goes the employees go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your meal. One time my husband's burger was over done and they quickly prepared him a new one and comped an extra side for him. SkinnyFats is a great place to catch a casual dinner, however I have yet to try their amazingly delicious looking  breakfast menu.

The line to check in was a bit long but it moved fairly quickly and when we got to the front the lady that helped us was great. She was friendly, quick and efficient, just what I like. The hotel was well kept and very kid friendly, which I love because I have two kids that I will be bringing on our next trip to Vegas. I love that is smack dab in the middle of the fabulous Las Vegas Strip. Another plus is that there are walk ways and a tram to 3 other hotel/casinos, which as you know if you've been to Vegas, is a heaven send limiting your time in the dry desert heat. \nExcalibur has a variety of good eats, slots, shops, tables and entertainment. There is even a Starbucks right in the lobby!\nMy suggestion on your next trip to Vegas, consider Excalibur as your choice, but don't forget to ask about getting a mini fridge in your room, don't assume that there will be one, like I did."}]
