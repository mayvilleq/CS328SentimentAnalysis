I've been cooking for 45 years and many turkeys (!) have come and gone - but this one was so memorable from start to finish.  It was my first time in the shop and the Gasparro family went above and beyond to get me the size bird I needed on short notice (something called \"service\" that you don't often see anymore!)   Just one look at the raw bird and you could see the difference - plump, smooth, nice taut skin... I carried it home like a baby!  Then I made a stuffing with their lovely Italian sausage and prosciutto.  I convection-roasted and basted the beauty regularly with TLC, protecting the breast with foil until the last hour.  It came out of the oven so golden, so gorgeous - like the one's in magazines!  It carved like butter - it tasted like heaven!  Even though I made a traditional gravy and another mushroom \"sauce\" to accompany - it needed neither.  The taste and texture of the meat stood all by itself - flavourful and succulent - each bite a marvel!   As I write this, I can smell the clear, golden stock simmering down from the bones.  This will be frozen for our next family feast at Christmas -  I can hardly wait!!!\nThank you pappa Gasparro and sons for helping cooks create wonderful meals and memories with the your excellent meats and service!", "business_id": "wbBxCkhmz4bXbKb7PmXE2Q", "cool": 0, "useful": 1}, {"date": "2015-10-22", "stars": 5, "review_id": "23NzXc-D-KcdNX4qeQveKA", "user_id": "qVn0zsYUBWDnNycg8ibGQg", "funny": 0, "text": "My Girl Kahea..\nBest photographer in my book.\nVery creative,  funny to work with,  reasonable prices,  very professional and very open to suggestions.\nWe have had 3 photo shoots with Cococubphoto and results have been excellent.\nHave 3 events coming up for Prom,  family photos and Graduation party.

I managed to steal a slot for 3 on Sunday 12pm, and brought my crew here for some pinkies-up moments. \n\nThe ambience is exquisitely beautiful with floor to ceiling windows brightening up the place, and sunlight bouncing off of pink orchids and wooden panels. Seating is quite spread out; giving you plenty of privacy to laugh at your gossips, but the chairs are old and worn out on the edges. \n\nWe went with the $44 Classic option that comes with a pot of tea (sparkling wine is available at few dollars more) and we all cooed at the wooden box full of specialty-blended tea inserted in like individual jewels.  There are three rows of tea from non-caffeinated to caffeinated hand-crafted by a special tea lady sold under the label Sloane.  I love the high-end tea apparatus that DEQ has invested, as every tea is steeped within a La Creuset pot @$55/each.  However, teas are not supposed to be drowned in the pot, rather, they should be steeped, and then taken out on the side, and only to be put in the tea pot when the next steeping is required. \n \nThe savories came first, and of course the presentation is a show-stopper and a kodac moment for people who like to take photos of their food.  There was the karage slider representing the Japan theme which is interesting but I wished it was warm.  The pepper and eggplant flat bread was a meh, but the shrimp pastry was light and balanced. Our favorite was the smoked salmon croissant with pickled Daikon (tribute to Japan) - the sweet and crunchiness of the pickled daikon is beautifully juxtaposed against the saltiness and soft texture of the salmon. \n\nI must disappointingly claim that the sweets were not good, including the scone except the passion fruit puff. The puff was light, airy and the filling was just the right balance of sweet and sourness of passion fruit.  \n\nThe yuzu tart was interesting - thanks for inserting that Japan theme in there but I didn't think it worked well.  The matcha and strawberry cake was fluffy, but the combination of the bitterness of matcha and sweet and sourness of strawberry didn't work well either. \n\nOnto the raisin cake that was cutely decorated with a layer of white icing and a sakura candy - cute, but the cake was quite dry and average.  The green tea sable cookies were alright on their own, but I would go easy on the sugar dusts because they over-power the cookie. \n\nAnd lastly I hate to say that the scone was meh, because scone is almost the standard upon which an afternoon tea is judged.  It was not a rock, it had reasonably fluff, but it was dry, and it was cold.  When I asked the waitress if she recommend eating scones first, she recommended it last because it might be too heavy and fills you up.  However by the time you make it to the scones they are cold, and sad, and we were sad. \n\nOverall would I recommend this place? Well given the average price of an afternoon tea in the downtown area is $37.50 - $50, then sure, based on what you get in comparison to other places then okay.  But if I were to evaluate on absolutely terms I'd rather have spent the money on bakeries that do well on one/few single items, than to shell out for a mish-mash afternoon tea. \n\nCheerio!", "business_id": "QgdO29fGB-eBNe1BzHR7YQ", "cool": 0, "useful": 0}, {"date": "2016-08-08", "stars": 5, "review_id": "De87tmUp7G8T9OkP_KNw_Q", "user_id": "fX-mfPC825spNvQVRV-7JA", "funny": 1, "text": "Tried this place out this morning because it's so close to my house....I have not ONE complaint!

Our Salesman, Mike M, was absolutely incredible, polite, professional, knew his cars, and so down to earth.  He was so easy to work with and made us feel right at home from the 1st phone call we initiated to Arrowhead Cadillac to the minute we stepped inside the dealership.  he has extensive knowledge of the Escalade we purchased, reviewed everything with us and made sure we understood the car before driving away in it.  It was also nice to see that other potential buyers and the Sales Managers were happy, even laughing, for that matter.  This is not the norm for dealerships and this has been the most relaxed purchase,  perfect, professional and positive atmosphere we have ever experienced!  We will be back in the future, I am sure of that and will not purchase our cars elsewhere.  We will definitely recommend Arrowhead Cadillac and specifically Mike M to our friends and family.

A year ago I visited Ramsay Steak and felt the place had its good points and bad points. My food was great but the restaurant seemed crazy and confusing. Because of the noise we got the wrong water and drank 3 bottles between the 5 of us and it cost us $27! It was loud and busy but the food was enough for me to come back for a second time. This time it was just me and the wife and we were seated on the second floor over looking the restaurant. It was much quieter and enjoyed the atmosphere. We were sure to get the house water this time and save some money! We ordered a couple appetizers. The first was the gnocchi with heirloom tomatoes and trumpet mushrooms. The gnocchi was cooked well with great flavor and a decent portion size. The second appetizer stole the show. It was the Kurobuta Pork Belly with cheesy grits, tomato jam and pork jus. It was exploding with flavor and left me wanting more! For dinner we had the roasted beef Wellington for two. The meat was cooked perfectly and the red wine Demi-glace was amazing. With 2 apps, a couple of signature meat dishes and a couple mixed drinks it came out to just under $200. For the service, the atmosphere, and the amazing food, I feel it is a must visit.", "business_id": "OETh78qcgDltvHULowwhJg", "cool": 0, "useful": 0}, {"date": "2018-02-25", "stars": 5, "review_id": "Nfuq_b3itgIGtCoPYl5mgQ", "user_id": "kLLjtwneIaTjnzNb1SkPeQ", "funny": 0, "text": "This place is amazing!!

I've had Mexican mochas in the past, but nothing like this one. Spicy upon first sip, I couldn't decide how I felt about it. But after the first sip, with the spicy warmth stuck in my throat, the next sequential sips were no longer surprising.
