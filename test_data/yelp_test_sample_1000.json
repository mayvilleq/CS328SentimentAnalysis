I could have got up and left but decided to stay and give them the benefit of the doubt, since I just wanted to eat. I was in the area and alI I wanted was my quick fix of AYCE Japanese regardless what restaurant it was now as long as the price was fair.\n\nAfter my first batch of food arrived, I was refused further service and from ordering anymore food. They gave me a load of twaddle about my first order being \"last call\" - if that was the case, they should have told me sooner so as to kindly give me a warning! So much for ALL YOU CAN EAT! Maybe they think I ordered too much and didn't want to lose money from big eaters. If you're going to be this way, then you shouldn't be offering all-you-can-eat then!\n\nFood was very average at best - nothing special at all but as I said earlier, I didn't come here expecting much. All I wanted was some cheap \"AYCE\" Japanese food and I didn't even leave feeling full!!! I would *never* visit here again until hell freezes over. Unless they see this and contact me in hopes of making reparations, I genuinely hope they will close down and make way for a much better place after they're gone.

Last month s bill was 803.64. I m not sure if larger apartments are the same but our electric bill ranges from 40.00-80.00.

There s a lady she has curly brown hair and thin I m sure everyone who comes will know who I m talking about well she s nice at first but after you sign your lease she s rude she might be Bipolar. We did not sign our lease with her but I have had to request maintenance to come and fix things, and it seems like she s annoyed. Okay now the carpet. It s clean at first but after awhile spots appear (we have no kids or pets and we take off our shoes) but what happens is that the people who lived here before I guess would spill things carpet cleaning only cleans the top layer not the foam (I think that s what it is) so I guess the bottom layer is still stained and as you walk on your carpet with time the stains will re appear. They should either get a new carpet cleaner or put new carpet every two years or something. I think living at one of the apartments further from the office would be a bad idea there s some characters around there and it seems like it s loud. I go over there to pick up my mail.

Me and my guy had been ring shopping together for months and had been to so many places (Tiffanys, Gordons,  Zales, Kay, a ton of online stores etc) and MJ was the very first time we enjoyed the ring shoping experience. Looking for rings should be a neat and special moment for a couple.\n\nJust a bit of a back story of our ring shopping travles: Every place we had gone to before MJ Christensen had pushed and pryed, from the immediate beginning,  to open an account at their store. It was literally within the first 10 minutes of looking! If they were to suggest that they HAVE financing options available,  so the couple knows they can afford what they might like, then ok I would appreciate the gesture. But this is not the case. Why would you insist on someone signing up for a credit card at your store when they're specifically telling you they don't know what they're looking for yet, and have never been to your store? It's common sense to me that within the first few minutes, this person simply isn't going to want to sign up for a credit card when they don't even know if they like your product. This is an extremely important customer service job as these sales reps are helping a person select a ring for a once in a lifetime occasion, or at the least a very special occasion. My experience with all of the places I had gone to before MJ were that they were far more concerned with having us open an account, than actually taking the journey of helping us find what we liked and 'god forbid' just  had gotten excited for us first. I hesitated at all of these places to ask to try things on, because I just felt that their lackluster bedside manner insinuated being annoyed if they had to pull out another ring. Deep sighs, looking around as if trying to memorize the texture on the walls, and everything short of drumming their fingernails on the counter yelling 'OH COMMON!' Haha. I of course am taking it to a bit of a dramatic level, but that's seriously just about how unenthusiastic these people seemed to be to help you look for the ring you're planning on wearing forever! Now with that said you will better appreciate the feedback I had with MJ. \n\nMe and my guy walked in (prepping for our much rehearsed responses to dreaded car salesmen tactics we were accustomed to at this point) and immediately we were greeted with smiles, and a hospitable energy in the room. Leah was the amazing woman who made this experience the perfect one we had always invisioned it to be when we began looking. Not once did she bring up opening an account or ask how we plan to pay. She kept a close eye on the rings we liked and what our abstract taste was, and it wasn't long before she took the reigns and instinctively knew what rings we would like from each case. She started us at the beginning of the cases for wedding ring selections, and put aside our favorites from each one. We must have tried on 30 rings collectively! Then at the end of the last case of options, she grabbed our favorites from each case and helped us narrow down our top two or three. She was very informative, sweet, efficient and easy to conversate with during the entirety of our journey together. At the end she just took some information down from my guy and told him she would contact him and at that time she has plenty of options available for him to afford the rings I fell for. This offered an opportunity for him to be able to select one of the few I narrowed down, allowing the element of surprise for me still, and also letting him have the privacy of how he would pay so that the moment wasn't spoiled by guilt of numbers. \n\n I am sad to see the negative feedback for this neat company over ridiculous things like them putting flyers on people's cars. I hate flyers on my car as much as the next person, but anybody who has been a business owner (and I have) would understand that this is a way of marketing your product.  I grew up near this Boca park center and use to be a massage therapist at the massage envy literally a few doors down from this MJ store, and I had NO idea it was there. I never paid attention because I didn't have the thoughts of engagement rings on my mind at those times. We've ALL had those moments where we gps a place and realize its been under our noses the entire time. I do know that it is frustrating to see jewelery fade over time, but certain metals tarnish over time. And when we saw Leah she very much ran through the pros and cons of all the metals we had to choose from; specifically those that would tarnish. But these metals are the cheaper ones, so it makes sense why you'd order them if you're getting rings for an entire team of people.  Please just take things with a grain of salt with other people's reviews. This place deserves praise for such a memorable way of dealing with special and unforgettable moments with their guests.

In fact, this is the only place you absolutely must visit when in Vegas.  I might actually fly here just for this.  \n\nTo understand Wicked Spoon, begin by remembering everything you know about buffets.  Food is bland to please the middle, heaping portions of filling foods are urged on you by the display, food is overcooked and unoriginal - now, reverse everything - that's Wicked Spoon.  Daring and original culinary creations - yes, in a buffet.  Small, preplated portions that force you to eat small amounts of quality food rather than huge amounts of quantity food.  It is absolutely unreal.\n\nSpeaking of which, there are many buffet rules to break here.  For instance, I make it a rule not to eat bread at a buffet - but what about homemade rolls that are the lightest yet richest bread I've ever eaten?  That I'll eat.  Never get salad at a buffet, right - except they have an entire station of tiny portions of amazing salads.  They take chances here - it's not the prime rib and fried everything else buffet.  The food is of the type and quality that you wouldn't be surprised if it were $100 a plate.  \n\nAlso, there are 2 wine options - all you can drink of red or white house wine for $9, or for $15, you get a card to use at a tasting machine and you can get small portions of a number of different wines.  The latter is very useful if you want to match wines to eat plate you get.  \n\nShould you save space for dessert?  I'll say no.  It seems that Vegas has a rule requiring all buffets to serve the exact same desserts, mostly in small clear plastic cups, with the exception that each buffet also has one special item.  Here, the dessert item to go for (if you must go for one) is the real gelato, scooped to order.", "useful": 1, "cool": 1, "user_id": "ZUGeoQ8GS2TlOk38v23rIw", "review_id": "Wect4-aHXJ7jDqt9iE3ubA"}, {"date": "2016-05-07", "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "business_id": "2HKQSZxgfixCLRZQLHdo-A", "text": "Cute little place tucked away in a small strip mall.

I called the restaurant to let them know. At the time they were really good about it and promised me a credit towards another large pizza. \n\nFast forward to tonight, I called in to use the credit and Mike, who I think is the owner, said he couldn't find a record of the credit. He said they hired some new employees and that they move stuff around and maybe that was why he couldn't find the slip. To me it simply felt like he didn't want to provide the credit. In short, he said he couldn't honour the credit without a record because people often try to scam them for free food.\n\nThat's totally understandable but I had the previous order number from Skip the Dishes. Not to mention, he acknowledged that his staff often lose the slips. I gave him the order number over the phone and he rather colourfully replied that I should go *expletive* myself and hung up. I actually had a picture too but you can't really show that over the phone. I attached it below to the review.\n\nThe guy was probably having a bad day or something but I can't recommend a place that swears at customers and hangs up on them. Especially, when I still had the receipt. To be fair, the times I've ordered pizza before it has always been pretty good but I agree with other people that the delivery time can be quite long.\n\nAn okay late night option but if customer service is important to you there are other great options in the area like Niko's or Pizzeria Gaga.", "useful": 1, "cool": 0, "user_id": "N4zkT9V8bOEEnY0LOzzGrA", "review_id": "vFoUlla4yVVKk0dkRI9qDA"}, {"date": "2013-04-27", "stars": 2, "funny": 0, "business_id": "rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw", "text": "Not much selections.

Our friends still at the hotel also attempted to retrieve it, but were told they too had to wait for housekeeping. Awaiting a return call, I also left a msg when we arrived home that evening, knowing time was of the essence. I followed up the next morning, as no one returned my call, and was told that nothing has been turned in. I was directed to Guest Claims to file a claim, which I did, and also a police report, yet they confirmed no one had checked into our room yet. Even though a \"thorough\" investigation was to take place, I received a call the next day saying that they would be happy to provide an insurance letter because they simply could not \"accuse\" anyone of impropriety and nothing was found, however the fact is that it didn't disappear into thin air. Each time I have called, they either had my name or check out date incorrect, which leads us to believe that they never had any intention of restoring our item to us.\nHonestly, I would have never expected this from the Wynn. While the facility was lovely, this behavior is unacceptable. I even left a message for Christopher Fox, the assistant manager 6 days ago to review the matter, but never received a call back. This lack of concern and frankly, dishonesty, is appalling. Judging from several other recent reviews, the theft is becoming an epidemic.\nIt's a shame that a supposed luxury resort would conduct itself this way, just awful.

There are plenty of brand new apartments going up all over the valley.  Don't waste your money on this one!  It's no longer managed by Greystar and no longer worth it. \nMy experience with Cactus started off really great, however, after the change in management it started to go downhill. \nPrior to Olympus taking over, Greystar was always responsive to my calls and e-mails.  Management would walk the property several times per day to make sure things were in order. Maintenance was great, personable, friendly and responsive. The grounds were kept up and the pool was spotless. Maintenance was out daily cleaning the lounges, sweeping the pool and hosing off the pool deck. They really set a high bar and unfortunately Olympus is falling short. \nThe change in management was sudden and without warning, other than some rumblings from residents. The new management took over, planted new signs but made little effort to introduce themselves to residents. Communication has continued to be poor, emails are not returned at all.  I had sent several requests for maintenance because I wasn't able to get into the  resident portal and each went unanswered. When I went down to the office and told them that I had emailed about something she said, \"oh are you Courtney\"?  So they got my requests but chose not to reply. Any requests made to staff are met with interrogations and almost a questioning air as if they don't believe what you're telling them. \nFilthy pool, filthy stairs and hallways are what you'll encounter here. The lounge chairs are gross, every one of them. The pool waterfalls have so much calcium/chlorine buildup on them that it's about an inch thick at this point. There are always cigarette butts in the cracks and we even found a dirty diaper stuck in a seat. \n\nThe stairs and hallways are dirty and their solution is to use a blower. EVERY DAY you'll be awoken by the noise of the lawn blower around 8/9am. What are they blowing?  The lawn people come each week so there's really no need for the noise pollution.  A good high pressure water sprayer once in a while would work miracles. \n\nDon't leave packages out, they'll be stolen by other residents and you'll find the packaging in recycling.\n\nI'm sure I've forgotten some things, but these are probably the most important. \n\nUpdate: upon move out, looks like they've hired another maintenance person who was washing the hallways.

I have two units for my main level and one for my basement.  For one week, I moved in to my guest room while I researched multiple AC companies.  I had used one small company (not Pro Solutions) for repair a couple of years ago and called them on the day it went out.  The owner of that company was the one who came out and evaluated my broken system.  He tested and a $200 repair with a capacitor would get it running again, but he looked at my unit, which was old, and already had a \"booster\" and so this company suggested my AC unit (10 years old) was likely on its last year.  So I decided it may be a good time to upgrade to more energy efficient units , and decided to get bids to replace all of my units with the hopes of getting additional discounts for multiple unit purchases.  Besides, my electricity bills have been pretty high this summer.\n\nI filled out a form online that assigned me to 4 companies.  Within minutes of filling the internet form out on a saturday around 5 pm, Don the owner of Pro Solutions Air called me to discuss my needs.  Of note, none of the other 3 companies contacted me until Monday the following week.  Over the next 4 days, I got multiple bids-- I got a bid from the original company I had used a couple of years ago and the owner agent who initially came out.  When he looked at my units in the ceiling, he said it was going to be a very difficult install.  In fact, he said \"I don't think we can do this one\" but he did price the units out. Don with Pro Solutions then came over and gave me a very competitive bid.  I then got another visit/bid from a larger AC company.  When I showed these other two companies the bid I received from Pro Solutions, the first company said--\"I think you should take that offer if they have good reviews online and with the BBB\".  There are only two previous yelp reviews which aren't very good but these were not for new units.  In looking at other online review sites, Pro Solution has much better reviews then here on Yelp.  I then looked up BBB and they have a A+ rating.  I then called Lennox to make sure they are a certified dealer, which they are.  I then went to Home Depot and got a phone bid, and then one other company.  Pro Solutions was about $2500 less than the larger company, and about $1000 less than the original company I had used a couple of years ago.  They were about $300 more than the Home Depot bids but the companies used by Home Depot have poor reviews on every single web site I checked out.  So Pro Solutions had the best price for the best overall reviews.\n\nThe thing that absolutely set Pro Solutions apart is their warranty:  10  years, parts, compressor, $75 labor deductible for 10 years (so if they have to come out for any reason and do any amount of work, whether it is one hour or 10 hours, only $75).  No other company had such an option.  All the other companies had an \"extended labor warranty\" which is offered by Lennox (the units I was looking at) , and they were going to charge around $600-$800 for each unit--so for me (looking at purchasing 3 new units), that would have been an additional $1800-$2400 (not even included in the prices above)  With Pro Solutions, you basically \"pay as you need it\"  and with these newer AC units, I am hoping the amount of issues will hopefully be few and far between.  The other thing that set Pro Solutions apart was they give you 10 year annual maintenance visit for FREE--no trip charge, no $75.  So basically, it is in their interest to keep these machines running well because if there is lot of issues, the labor costs would go up and up.\n\nI called Don multiple times while I was doing my research--he personally answered his phone every single time!!! Many of the other companies had voicemail, and often took a while to return my calls.  The customer service I received was the best by far.\n\nThe main install was done by Job, who has worked with Don for many years.  He and his crew worked in my ceiling which has very limited space, and the temp in my house was 97 degrees.  I felt bad for such a difficult install in the heat but the whole crew was very professional and didn't mind me checking in on them, and took time to explain things to me.\n\nSo for now, I have been completely happy with my decision.  All three AC units are working nicely.   If I have any problems in the future with my units or Pro Solutions, I will update my review.", "useful": 3, "cool": 1, "user_id": "3991JTXXwpFL7WjIxNA8og", "review_id": "kDxlxDZ2OHPw0qAS_suUtw"}, {"date": "2012-10-24", "stars": 1, "funny": 1, "business_id": "7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ", "text": "I had a gift certificate or otherwise I would never have gone there.

It's a city in its own and you never have to leave if you can afford it. There are lots of entertainment options right on the property from Circque de Soleil, to a comedy club below the lobby. It has an arena with top acts currently touring the country appearing nightly.\n     The rooms are very nice and the beds are soft and comfortable.\n    It has a beautiful pool area with a lazy river.\nIt has many restaurants, some great and some greatly over rated. I found Emeral's in the latter catagory. Their Knob Hill bar served me an eleven dollar pair of ribs appitizer that had actually been fried into unchewable leather. The fish and chips in the coffee shop is excellent and I've never had a bad breakfast there and I've probably had at least fifty breakfasts there.\n    If you're into night-clubbing they have Studio 54 and Club Tabu.\n\n      A current downside (4/4/12 is that its undergoing renovation and the jackhammers start at 9AM.\n      Room service is pricey and the wait is long. A pal ordered a shrimp cocktail and a beer and I think it was $50.\n      The Will Call for the arena is untrustworthy. I left two tickets to the ACMA's for guests and when my guests got there the tickets had disappeared. Two other people were sitting in their seats.\n       If you have a room with a door that adjoins another room you can hear the people in that room like they are in your room.\n      I spent eighteen minutes on a house phone trying to get an operator listening to a recording tell me how much they cared about my business. The line eventually went dead without anyone ever answering. I was ready to rip the phone off the wall.\n      A small but highly annoying detail: Bring your own moisturizer. They have these tall square bottles that don't squeeze easily. When you do squeeze hard enough to get some out, it all comes out. It looked like the money shot from a large animal in a porn produced by Animal Planet. I had conditioner all over my Dopp Kit, medicine bottles, the counter, the mirror. It was a big mess.

It is large enough to accommodate a lot of dogs and people (which there are at peak times), has lots of grass, 2 doggy water fountains so they don't have to drink out of community bowls, trees around the perimeter and a ramada with tables/benches, and other benches located around the perimeter. It is open early in the morning and late at night (there are lights on until 10 PM). There are also city supplied poop bags in dispensers which are usually stocked (although occasionally not, so bringing a bag doesn't hurt).   The people are pretty friendly and the poop  situation (people that don't clean it up) isn't that bad in comparison with many other parks, especially Cosmo and Chaparral. There is only one large section (no small or inactive section), but it seems to work out OK as the dogs aren't overly rowdy or aggressive in general. I've never seen a real fight. There is a sort of walking path around the entire perimeter and many do walk it for exercise.  Overall, a well above average place to take your dog.  \n\nLOCATION:  It's a little hard to find.

Fifteen minutes later we show up at this shop with no appt. and were greeted by the owner Mr. Tom. We explained our problems to him and he gave us a couple different options.

Tom took the car in back and started to work on it. 10 minutes later he came back out and explain to us what the real problem was.One of the spark plugs were loose and the turbo hose was collapsing under pressure, therefore causing the engine to hesitate at low speeds. We now realize that we were ripped off badly by the dealership. Not even a month and we are experiencing the same problems they said the fixed.Tom said I have good news and good news!!  We can fix it, the problem will be solved and I will give you  90 day warranty on our work. Tom fixed the problem that the dealership didn't and only charged us $289.00.

The vehicle was brought around for us to test drive. As we walked out to the car with our salesman, another group of customers and their salesperson were coming in the door we were exiting and were gawking at the vehicle as if they'd never seen it before (reading the sheet on the side and peering inside to view the interior.) They were literally in the way and preventing us from entering the vehicle for us to test drive it. They finally moved and we took the car on a 2 min drive (exited the dealership on Pioneer Way, made a u-turn at the first break in the median on Sahara, made the next u-turn, pulled into the dealership) We had already test driven CR-V's at Carmax earlier in the day, so we just wanted to check that everything was running smoothly in that particular vehicle. Upon arrival at the dealership, we asked our salesmen to check to see how much they would give us for our current vehicle. He came back and said $3500. We laughed as Carmax had said they would give us $6000. He took the sheet and went to see what they could do, came back and said they would give us the $6000 and said he had mistakenly looked at another car that was the same make as ours in the system that was valued at less. Clearly a lie. We began the paperwork on the car - the salesman had taken the paperwork out of the 2012 vehicle and had the keys to the car on the desk and we had the final price for the car approved by the manager - we were there for two hours when another salesmen comes over and asks for the keys to the car. Our salesmen tells him its already been sold and the other salesmen says no, he's sold it and that the general sales manager has told our salesperson to give the other salesman the keys. After our salesperson tries to reason with the general manager, he says there is nothing he can do - the other people started the paperwork first - which was obviously a blatant lie. They literally would have had to start the paperwork in the 2 mins we were test driving the vehicle and our salesperson told us their policy was if you were selling a car, you had the keys and paperwork from inside the vehicle and when he went to get the keys to bring it for the test drive, no one else had them or was looking for them. It would have been fine if the other salesman had come over when we returned from the test drive and asked for the keys saying it was sold, but instead we wasted 2 hours of our time. The other salesman also said the people purchasing the car had come in three days ago and had test driven the vehicle earlier in the day, which our salesperson said was a lie. The general sales manager was also completely rude about the situation - instead of apologizing for their screw up (not realizing they were selling the same car to two different people - which they obviously knew) and asking how they could rectify the situation, he just kept repeating they had started the paperwork first and it wasn't his problem. We wanted to leave the dealership but our salesperson still had to the keys to our current vehicle (since it was inspected for the trade-in value). He finally reluctantly gave them back to us after another 20 mins of him supposedly trying to  talk to the GSM. We left the dealer and contacted another manager to complain about the abysmal treatment we received. They clearly knew they had been in the wrong because they offered us a deal on a new 2014 CR-V which we foolishly took. I say foolishly because we chose to intentionally deal with people who clearly had no qualms about lying to sell you car. By far the worst car buying experience we've ever had. Would NOT recommend purchasing a vehicle from this dealership.", "useful": 0, "cool": 0, "user_id": "rPG1OGhCTW4_kSNjduol0Q", "review_id": "WXoZnC3Ho904CsQviy3_JA"}, {"date": "2015-03-09", "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "business_id": "txrnn0nUe9-RSowaGAG1PA", "text": "I love it here the place may not be so attractive but the employees are what matter to me I usually go to jacklyn and she's amazing but today she wasn't in and a very nice lady named Maryam was and she wowed me she gave me exactly what I asked for.

Dishonesty, aggressive tactics, and they are unconcerned with what a possible customer wants.\n\nWe did not buy a car here.  There are a variety of reasons why.\n\nWhen we stopped by the lot to look at vehicles and get more information, we definitely got the hard sell (from Tom Flanagan).  We told them we were just getting information and that they were our first stop.  After several dodgy (and later found to be untrue) answers, we decided to leave.  They pushed us to make an appointment to come back in and we declined.  We specifically told them to not call us too often, as this would actually deter us from buying from them.  They of course called us four times within 3 days (and more later).\n\nWithin a day, I sent out several requests to dealers (via Edmunds) to get information about different vehicles.  Showcase was included in that list.  Out of the 20+ dealers I contacted, Showcase was the worst to deal with.\n\nI never got the information (an OTD price) I requested with over 6 e-mails going back and forth (with Alex Ivanov and Matt LaRussa).  They purposefully instead would give me a price for a vehicle we weren't interested in, even after I told them 4x EXACTLY what we wanted.  Every other dealership was able to do this, some with just one e-mail.\n\nWhile sending e-mails back and forth, Showcase would call at least every other day (too often).  Once even twice a day, often three days in a row.   This went on over a two week period.\n\nMeanwhile, Showcase set up a test drive appointment without me showing interest in doing so.  This led to even more e-mails reminding me of an appointment that I never made.  And a call from them later because they wanted to reschedule the appointment.\n\nBased on the numerous e-mails, telephone calls, and people we had contact with at Showcase Honda, I don't think this is a few bad apples in the bunch.

I asked for a medium rare steak and did they deliver! The steak was juicy and nicely charred on the outside, giving it an authentic smokey taste. Though this may have been the main part of the dish, the ranchero chips may have slightly outperformed the steak. Their chips are housemade and seasoned with a multitude of spices, with a basis that seems to be paprika and cayenne pepper. The chips laid on a bed of refried beans and was topped with eggs (any style you choose), avocado, cheddar and cotija cheese. The chips were still crunchy and was served with a side of sour cream and salsa.

In 11 years, I suppose that these places have pretty much vanished. There are almost no places that serve smaller portions with dine in areas besides Pizza Hut, and the closest Pizza Hut in Mindapore have now turned into a daycare. I wonder if these kids who go there eat pizza everyday, or if Pizza Hut is now catering exclusively for them? Most other franchises only have take out and delivery. This place in my mind preserves some old charm, as they sell pizzas in individual sizes. This is better than pizza by the slice because my dad and I ordered two different pizzas and we could share. For little kids, there are crayons behind the pop machine and colouring books available. I flipped through the colouring books, and to no surprise, the majority of the pages are already coloured in, and the kids didn't bother to take their artwork with them! Nevertheless, what kid doesn't like free  colouring pages? I mean as a 90s baby a.k.a pre iPad addiction baby, these were my life! I'm sure there are some empty pages.  They also have pop with free refills in reusable  hard plastic( better if they are glass but oh well I'd give them credit) cups. Now, this is another old charm that I like, similar to A&Ws. To me, pop is best served in a clear reusable cup so that you can see the drink inside, makes it look more refreshing. The fast food paper cups are lame. The pizza, don't expect this to be fast food, because he makes each pizza individually, but it's fairly quick and there's a Red Sox game on TV and music for entertainment. The pizza is thin crust, all their pizzas are thin crust and the salami and green pepper was pretty good. Only problem was that almost all the green pepper fell onto the metal plate underneath( they serve it on a plate, not a box unlike Coco Brooks). My dad ordered a 5 topping pizza and most of the veggie toppings fell off too. There was an option for a 6 or more topping individual pizza, I am almost afraid to imagine how that would turn out.. maybe only the pepperoni and cheese would stay on... Overall the atmosphere was decent, and by the way there's a really funny ad in the women's bathroom, what is it you ask? Too embarrassed to say, go check it out for yourselves ladies. No, it's not period supplies or birth control, if it was then I wouldn't be afraid to admit it, it's something way more sensitive.  I would dare them to put the ad in the men's washroom and see the reaction. Would they die of laughter or get angry? I don't know, maybe both. There's also a less embarrassing funny sign outside.

The Exhibition.\n\nI got a free ticket to Bodies after donating blood at a drive held at the Tropicana, which is the same venue that hosts Bodies.  Already in the medical frame of mind, I found this incredibly fascinating.  All of the displays are actual human bodies preserved, chopped up and dissected to show us all how we work.  You get a look at the skeletal, nervous, endocrine and other systems.  For a nominal fee you can get headphones that come with a soundtrack to guide you through the exhibit.\n\nThere's also a portion of the exhibit that comes with a warning that shows preserved human fetuses in varying stages of development.  Incredibly interesting to see something like that close up.  You also learn where these bodies come from.  Turns out many of them are from China.  Just passing through the exhibit makes you think not only about what you're seeing when it comes to the science of it all, but also works your imagination.  I kept wondering who these people were, what they were like, etc.\n\nIn short, do yourself a favor and go see this.

But after my experience, I was so appauled that I felt the need to register with yelp to write a review and inform others of the terrible experience.  The food was average - I had the potato lobster soup which was bland and luke warm as well as a tuna maki roll and the steamed mussels.  The sushi and mussels were as expected - nothing stellar. \n\nThe service was what eventually ruined the night.  I had brought my husband and friends to LV for a 30th birthday party, so we were ready to celebrate.  Everyone's dinners came out at different times over a 20 minute time period.  One dinner was wrong and had to be re-done.  By the time it came out everyone was finished eating an the steak was raw!  When we told our server of our issues with this, his response was \"if I take it off the bill, will that make you happy?\"  After spending a large amount of money - we were told we had to write down on the receipt how they should split the check up.  Quite a tedious process with 12 diners after they told us at the begninng splitting is not a problem.  From there, the server took over 40 mins to split up the checks.  I checked in with the manager as we had reservations elsewhere that were approaching.  He was quite rude and told me they were\" handling it\" and continued to fight with me when I told him our displeasure with the experience.  I was never apologized to nor even given the common courtesy of an explanation or that they understood my frustrations.  \n\nAs the icing on the cake, I was finally walking out of the restaurant.  As I passed by the manager I had spoken to, he made eye contact with me and didn't even say a word.  No \"have a nice night\", no \"thanks for dining with us\"...NOTHING.\n\nI will never go back to this restaurant or anything with Rick Moonen's name on it.

The pho itself was more or less like any other pho places, but the snacks here are definitely worth checking out! The shrimp rolls had some extra greens in it compared to other Vietnamese places that give it a nice twist (though my siblings didn't like this slight additions, I felt that it was refreshing). The shrimp on sugar cane came with a side of veggies, which complemented it REALLY well -- the greens offset the savouriness and oil in the deep fried dish well. In general, what really gave the sides an extra \"mph\" compared with other Vietnamese places was the side of greens and the general harmony of the tastes each dish delivered. The sides themselves were already above par in tastes, and the extra garnishes they put there gave it both aesthetic and culinary taste.\n\nAmbiance 2.5/5 (15% of final grade)\nThere wasn't much to say about the general ambiance-- step in and you expect it to be just like any other Vietnamese restaurant. It was obvious that they didn't really try to win customers over with superior interior decor. They did, however, fulfilled the norms by keeping the place clean-- even the seafood sauce and sriracha sauce squirt bottles didn't have and sauce residue on them (which was nice to see, because having a chunk of dried sauce on the tip of the squirt-er always looks nasty).\n\nService 3/5 (15% of final grade)\nWe were promptly seated as soon as we got in, and there were already menus on the table, so we didn't have to wait for them to bring us menus. Tea was also very quickly put onto the table for us when the lady server left a pencil and a page and told us to fill it in ourselves (which was, in my opinion, better, because I could take as much time as I liked figuring out what to order). When I asked the lady about what the \"three coloured ice\" drink was, she readily described it and recommended this supposedly popular drink. The best thing was that she didn't have an attitude like you would see in most east-Asian establishments. Sure, she wasn't totally enthusiastic about the dishes, but she did have a tone of patience in her voice, which is nice.\n\nCost 3/5 (10% of final grade)\nFor the quality and taste of the food, this place was very reasonable! I went with my two siblings who eat a lot. We each got a drink and ordered 3 sides and a large pho to share. Everything costed us a little over $40 (tips and tax included) for lunch. I wanted to try more foods, so $40 was actually more than necessary, so if you just wanted to grab a cheap eat with a friend, an XL pho under $10 would easily hit the spot ;)\n\nOther 3/5 (10% of final grade)\nBrownie points round! When we walked in there was a boy around 12-13 years old who really expertly asked us how many people we had and directed us to a table. The lack of inhibition and gracefulness he had was very awesome for his age.

The servers time to cut the bread individually may have been better spent seeing that the side dishes were hot.  The meats on the skewers were very good with a selection of lamb, prime rib with cheese, sirloin, Mediterranean chicken and shrimp. The presentation of the dishes was however, hit and miss. Ended up trying to be served the same thing a number of times and then at the end of our meal they brought out different items. As well, we were informed that when you had your red/blue table card with the red side up it meant that you didn't want to be served by the gauchos and if it was on green that they were to serve you when they came by your table.

Like not poop your pants allergy, like every dr at southern hills hospital knows me allergy. Like I went out to eat and my throat is closing allergy. Like a dr telling you cant do this anymore allergy. So I was thrilled about this fish dish at the cute place that I could eat. So I made another reservation for last night for my other halfs birthday. Everyone ordered all these incredible dishes. The beets, the cauliflower, pasta, and I sat drinking a bubbly pino which was great patiently waiting for the fish dish. Well the waiter came back and said I couldnt hv it because there was butter in it and they couldnt mod. I told him that was the only thing I could eat last time. He said hed go back and ask. Back and forth they said okay well mod the fish and give you last weeks set up of the dish. Well maybe I upset the chef because the whole plate was burnt. The potatoes were burnt black and shriveled. The fish was burnt. The fennel was replaced with endives and were charred. It was almost inedible. But I politely ate the burnt fish and watched everyone else eat and drink. And our guests left and we stayed for dessert and digestif. Which our waiter brought us 3 drinks. One tasted and smelled of novacaine. When we brought this up to the waiter he compared it to a urinal cake. Confused as to why he would choose this for us as he thought it was that vulgar was off putting. The dessert was the third on the list topped w honeycomb. My boyfriend described it as root canal sweet and took 2 bites before we left mildly full and dissapointed after a 250 dollar bill.

From the web page, we almost thought it was going to be like a Chipotle style place where you just went down the line, picked your meatball, got some sauce on it, then took it to your seat.  This was a sit down place though with a full bar.  No big deal, it wasn't busy at all when we got there around noon, so we got seated immediately.  \n\nThe few people that were there when we got there were clearly hipster types, and so were many of the employees working there.  The place was also decorated very trendy, and they served you water in a big glass bottle they left on your table.  At this point, I was worried about how the food was going to be, since I've been to places like this before, like Burgatory where the food takes a back seat to the vibe of the place.  \n\nThe menu was simple, pretty much all you can order is meatballs, some sides, and some apps, but that's it.  No big deal on that as we went for the meatballs.  They had 4 types of meatballs on the menu, and she also mentioned they had a Cod meatball for lent.  They had a bunch of different sauces you could put on the meatballs, and then you can have them just as meatballs, or as a slider, sandwich, or panini.  I chose to have the sliders, because I wanted to try a few different meatballs and sauces.  I had the turkey meatball, the classic meatball, and the spicy pork meatball.  My wife had 2 classic meatball sliders, and we had the Parmesan fries to split.  \n\nWell, as expected, the food was fine, but nothing special.  The meatballs were actually kind of bland, only helped by the sauce you picked to put on them.  My wife said the same thing.  My wife has an Italian mother who makes home made meat balls, so we know what good meat balls taste like, and unfortunately, these just didn't do it for us.  The fries weren't bad.  About what you'd expect Parmesan fries to taste like anywhere.\n\nThe service was really great, so that's not reason not to go there, and the prices were also really good, as all the sandwiches were less than $10.  The sides were $5, but they are huge.  We split the fries, and couldn't even finish them.  I'd almost suggest they offer half portions for $3.50 or so, because if you can't decide on a side to split, you definitely don't want to order a whole side for yourself.\n\nOverall, I'd say go there once for yourself and see if you like it.

I ordered it warm but it is also served cold but I'm not sure how that would taste, the server suggested not to order cold unless you actually grew up eating it that way. The egg soaked up all the good flavor of the meat and the ground tender meatball type casing was so good. \n\nThe Fish and chips were yummy flaky batter and fries were just thick cut was fresh warm and crispy skin with soft potato inside. The mash and gravy served with the herb chicken was so tasty. \n\nI will be back for sure to try everything else like the flaky crust beef and mushroom pie and lamb stew and Yorkshire pudding omg looks so bomb. \n\nOk I have to stop cause my mouth is watering right now.

The other meal was a sit down, pre-selected 3 course dinner. The kitchen/servers had zero coordination.

The waiters were knowledgeable and prompt with their service. I got kind of a pretentious vibe from our waiter which was a little off putting. But it didnt bother me too much.\n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I was very impressed. The steak was soft and flavorful and melted in my mouth. The side dishes were just ok. We ordered broccoli, creamed spinach, and fingerling potatoes. I wasnt impressed by the sides all that much. Not extremely flavorful but still decent.\n\nWe also ordered a $200 bottle of wine which was the most expensive wine i have drank before. I didnt know much about it, the winery was called Mastery and it was a red wine. My bro ordered it not me and it was really good! It was listed on the last page of the wine menu and was $40 a glass, but we ordered a bottle for the table. i wish i figured out what wine it was but it was really really good.\n\nThis is a good spot for a vegas dinner and a great way to start the night! i would definitely check out some other places before i come back here but i recommend it!", "useful": 0, "cool": 0, "user_id": "mlnqX6MzQ0FxUbcVY782ww", "review_id": "HVxLt9-87zJVmIV377ArOQ"}, {"date": "2014-07-02", "stars": 4, "funny": 0, "business_id": "b2E_ahQNhMBu7soQIG2Gow", "text": "Cool new place on Roosevelt Row with inventive, flavorful and fresh cuisine!

I was expecting lots of seafood but their selection was kind of meh. I DID find chicken feet, pigs feet, frog legs, and whole baby octopi however. So I decided (bravely) to try them. \n\nFirst of all, I have no idea how you are supposed to eat chicken feet. It is, well, it's a freaking chicken foot. It's all bones with a little bit of skin on it. Just the way it looked was enough to make me gag. But I figured, I would probably not have this opportunity again. So I picked it up and was like, am I supposed to just bite into it? I decided not to and instead tried picking the \"meat\" off the bone. It was so tough - like rubber. I managed to get this eraser sized piece off and put it in my mouth. Blech! It was seasoned in some kind of chili sauce and was so tough, I couldn't even chew it. So I immediately spit it out. \n\nThen I moved onto the pigs foot. It looked like a little short rib and thankfully it didn't have the hoof still attached. But it was pure fat. I looked for any hint of meat, but there was none. So I bit into it (because you can). Blech! It's freaking like blubbery jelly. I almost lost it right then and there. The taste was like pork, but the texture grossed me out. \n\nI needed a minute to recover from that. But then I moved onto the frog leg. I picked a piece of meat off the bone. It's true what they say, that it tastes like chicken. The texture is like chicken too. It was almost like eating a chicken wing due to the size. It wasn't bad. But after I ate that little piece, I saw a long blue vein running through the rest of it. Then I saw more blue things inside. Just the visual was enough to put it down. Too bad because it tasted okay. \n\nI actually like octopus, but I've never had a whole one before. I was a little scared, but I started with the legs. It was good! So I quickly shoved the rest in my mouth and it was fine. Nothing squirted out, which I was afraid of. It was just chewy all around and tasted okay. \n\nSo did I ever get to try any crab? Well, when they finally brought it out I grabbed a few pieces and thought finally! But when I opened the claw, there was NO meat! WTF? What the hell kind of crab is this (it wasn't snow crab)? So I cracked open a leg. Again, very little meat and what was there, was dry and tasted extremely fishy. I got scared and didn't eat anymore. \n\nSo there was my adventure into the scary world of chinese seafood buffets. At least I got to cleanse my pallet with dry chocolate cake and some really good kahlua and cream like jello shot.

But, once you experience it, you'll realize that it has a small community-like feel to it because of how many volunteers work tirelessly to greet you, make sure you have a wonderful experience and make you feel you are important.\n\nThe services are very good. I actually started attending after I was released from the hospital for suicidal thoughts. After I kissed the ground upon my release, the first thing I remember doing was coming here. I share that because this church literally saved me. The services are very good for new Christians especially because the message is simple and usually very well delivered. I grew up going to church but still come away with something each week. \n\nI want to share a couple quick things beyond the obvious:\n\n1. The neighborhood groups are a good way to get plugged in to your community and fellowship with other Christians where you live. \n\n2. The Stars sports program is wonderful. I volunteer to coach soccer and it's been a great bonding experience for me and my son.\n\n3. Life Training is offered on Monday nights and it's also fantastic for new believers to learn about basic Christian principles and the teachers and guest speakers are genuine. The best part for me is the 'breakout sessions' afterwards that allow you to get together in small groups based on an identifying factor (ie: spiritual growth, divorce, substance abuse, sexual addiction etc.) and connect with others who might be going through similar life circumstances. It keeps me accountable.\n\n4. It's great for the kids! I have volunteered a couple of times in the kid's services and they are engaging and fun for them. Not to mention they take away important life lessons.\n\nWhat else can I say? Go!

Wow, I was so blown away that I'm pretty sure my boyfriend was sick of hearing me rave about the pizza. I've been to Italy multiple times, and every time I end up eating my weight in pizza because Italian style pizza is just divine: thin, soft but slightly chewy crust, thin but flavorful layer of sauce, and perfectly creamy mozzarella. This place had the perfect Italian style pizza outside of Italy, I was so shocked by the flavors and the texture of the pizza that I insisted we come back the following day. Also, the pizza was only $6 for a personal sized pizza! Comparable to the 5 euro pizzas I had back in Italy. I was so happy to find this place, and I will insist on going back every time I am in Vegas. Maybe I'll even try the seafood at some point... Likely not.

It had 3 sauces (all seperated) and all were delish. The sea bass was amazing! It had a lobster wine sauce on it and if I closed my eyes it was like I was eating a tender lobster. My husband enjoyed his hamburger very much. We also had the carrot cake and blood orange mousse for dessert. The carrot cake was good. The mousse was excellent. Even though the prices seem pricy,I felt the food was very well worth the cost.

We decided if we could get a deal on two vehicles we would buy hem both. the sales manager was a guy who basically killed the deal for Larry, he was rude , condescending and out right unpleasant, he threw a offer at me and pretty much said take it or leave it, I had at that point decided I wanted the vehicle but needed to take a break to grab a bite to eat and clear my head, buying a vehicle can be an overwhelming experience, mind you my car was still being   Serviced, the manager insisted we take the vehicle to drive, I told him we didn't want to we were going to walk and find a place near by, he rudely commented \" where are you going to go? There's nothing in walking distance \". At that  point he was pushing my patience, I decided forget it deal is off. We left . A day later I get a call back and Larry tells me how can we fix this? We come to an agreement and we talk out a price for the two vehicles, he says let me talk to his manger to finalize and he'd call me back. He calls me back and says \" we have a deal\" when do you want to come down pick up vehicles?  I arrange to leave work early and so does my wife so we can drive down the 100 miles from the verse valley to pick them up, 20 mins later the rude manager calls me back and try's to change the deal saying we need to pay more then we agreed. I could not believe it, the deal again fell through , totally dishonest and greedy sales managers ruin our experience , Id never buy a vehicle from this place again if it was the last dealership left in Arizona.

If I wanted to concern myself with veggies I would stay at home and save my money and eat at home. Anyways, their eggs benedict consists of the diner's ham off the bone, two eggs, mancini's bread and a pool of delicious hollandaise. There is no stinginess when it comes to this meal.

The first thing worth mentioning is the portion size, absolutely massive! Certainly enough to make a meal again the next day. The burro was packed with heaps of meat, perfectly cooked and seasoned, onions, tomatoes, cilantro - excellent. There are two chicken quesadillas on the menu, Charbroiled or Machacadilla. The charbroiled is only meat, the machacadilla adds veggies. The choice is yours, they are both great. The shrimp for the Shrimp Baja was very good, although it was probably my least favourite of the three dishes and lacked a punch.\n\nGreat Mexican beer selection (plus Bud Light if you prefer to drink water!) and although we didn't have one, the margaritas looked amazing.

I have to say that I was completely disappointed by this place on so many levels. Maybe part of this was due to the fact that I was so much looking forward to its opening only to be completely let down. Anyway, the long and the short of it is that they do some things right here but the burger itself is garbage. It's very much a poor mans (but twice the price) 5-Guys !! At 5-Guys the burger itself as well as the toppings are exactly crafted to your  taste. Its a little bit more expensive of course but you get what you pay for. Unfortunately at Hero Burger you pay more than 5-Guys burgers but get much less of the experience.  What's nice about this place is that the bread roll is somewhat boutique and you can order gratis extra sides and condiments however, when push comes to shove it has to be said that the burger itself is complete garbage. Lets put it this way, imagine going to the grocery store and finding Bubba Burger in the frozen section in 3 sizes. Well that's basically what you have at this joint. They don't even give you the option of cooking the burger to your taste (rare, medium well done). The chain sells itself on \"100% angus burger\" but I think 100% leather would be closer to the truth. What's even worse is that you have to request ketchup from behind the counter. If you are half way though your meal and you need more they are too cheap to have a condiment dispenser. You basically have to get back in line and order it. But wait, there's more.......if you want ice in your soda you have to get back in line too. This is the 21st century folks not Eastern Europe. There is hardy any seating in this restaurant but then the place is so bad that I know know why I was able to have a table to my self this evening. The final knock on this place is that the people behind the counter have a very poor grasp of the English language. Toronto is a very multicultural city but I find it annoying when I have repeat myself 3 fold in order to simply place my order. Do not be fooled by the nice shiny exterior and the high prices, stay away from this place like the plague. Its overpriced and not worth it.

She was pleasant and efficient and gets totally high marks.  The food is \"OK\" - nothing to go crazy over (except the biscuits - isn't that the highlight of every entr\u00e9e there?).  But I absolutely hate that the restaurant-teaching gurus think it's a good practice for the hostesses to ask their patrons \"how their day's been going\" as they seat them.  Every patron KNOWS that they've been told to do this.  And it's annoying.  How will they respond if someone tells them that their hemorrhoids have been flaring up?  Of course, most people won't be so candid and will say \"fine\", just like when the manager comes around to every table and asks if your meal is tasting wonderful (which he DID).  No, it's just \"OK\".  In fact, my baked potato was super dry, even WITH the extra butter that I requested, but I'm not going to share that information.  I just want to eat undisturbed.  If there's something wrong with my meal, I'll relay to my server.  Isn't that what they're THERE for?  I'm SOOOO not impressed when the managers come around to the tables.

The Dominion Tavern was so packed they were not accepting walk-ins or reservations. The old go-to Reuben's had a line-up waiting all the way outside. So were in a bit of a spot for dining out after the movie and I was in no mood for fast food or anything deep fried. We were walking around looking when we spotted Firegrill. Never been, so I figured it couldn't hurt to try... that was the beginning of the end...\n\nT H E   G O O D \nThe restaurant looks impeccably clean and has a nice woody, loungy feel to it. And who doesn't enjoy leathery banquettes? As a steakhouse fanatic, it's the environment I enjoy. The manager's hiring practice of female staff indicates a strong interest in, how do I put it... the bouncy factor, not that there's anything wrong with that. Our server was polite and very friendly despite what follows. The Good ends here.\n\nT H E   B A D \nThe management cannot control his patrons. When young patrons go hog-wild like it's spring break, management has to step in before losing customers. It's better to have a few unhappy kids, than a bad reputation - more on this later.\n\nIf your wait-staff is all dressed to a tee, the manager should be dressed like he owns the place, not like a retail clerk at a Reno-Depot. If you're the boss, look the part. \n\nT H E   U G L Y\nOK this is the part where you should get comfortable before going further. I'm about to go off on a rant, a diatribe, a disputation about basic rules of restoration and \"foodology\".\n\nFirst of all... this, where I live, my island, is MONTREAL, not Val D'or. There's a steak spice mix named after my town. I think one can expect delicious steaks in Montreal; it's one of our culinary call-to-fame. Right up there with smoked meat, bagels & poutine. So if you dare call yourself a steakhouse and serve crap, maybe you should leave my island. \n\nFirst my favourite quote from Bourdain that pretty much explains my views on restaurants and gastronomy.\n\n\"It says something about a person when you put chicken Caesar on the menu. You've crossed a line and you know it. It's the chef version of sucking Ron Jeremy's cock. If you do it late in your career, any notions of future stardom are usually pretty much out the window.\" -Anthony Bourdain, Medium raw.\n\nFiregrill makes the atrocious, grotesque and egregious error in seating itself downtown and serving food I wouldn't make for myself on a boring night after work. I would sooner eat at McDonald's everyday and get more contentment from it. Hell I can do better with supermarket grub. People go to restaurants to eat what they can't have at home - mostly to get crispy crunchy food, or better food than they can't prepare.\n\nI ordered the T-Bone... for connoisseurs the menu said. Connoisseurs call it a Porterhouse bitch, but I digress. It comes with soup or salad. Salads were the ubiquitous Caesar (see above) and of course the \"chef's salad\" whatever the fuck that means. I went for the soup, cream of broccoli. They forgot to mention it probably comes out of a can marked with the word Campbell's on it. It had the salt content of a canned soup and tasted like the 2 dollar soup I sometimes get at Tim Horton's (hey my expectations at Timmy's are different than when I dish out a lot of cash for a good meal.)\n\nBut I should have seen this coming when the bread came with butter in packets you have to unseal. Because whipping butter and serving it into a little ramequin is soooooooo much work right?\n\nBut it gets better... I mean worse...\n\nI get my T-Bone steak and it's about I dunno, barely a centimetre thick, the kind of cheap-ass steak you get at your local IGA. This steak was un-aged. How can you tell you may ask? Well first, the purpose of aging meat is to release it of its water and of course secondly, make the meat tender which results in a steak that cuts easy and is flavour packed. This T-Bone had nothing flavourful and was boiled by all the water that was steamed out during the cooking process. I couldn't see any spices or seasoning. The steak was pale and looked like the kind of steak hospital cafeterias push out on those special occasion meals. Even after pouring enough salt to clog an artery on it, I still couldn't get any flavour out of it. That's of course WHEN I was able to cut a piece of meat out of it without hacking at it because of all the non-tenderness of the meat and all the \"nerving\". I stopped after 2 \"bites\". \n\nAny steak connoisseur likes their steak, thick... really thick and will pay the big bucks to get it and get it right. The steak was barely grilled on one side, ungrilled on the other, conveniently faced down and looked and tasted boiled. And to make matters worse, there were metallic black spots on the steak indicating a dirty grille or tools. Unpleasant to say the least. And it was just served on a plate with nothing else. No herbs, no mushrooms, or grilled tomatoes, the regular, omnipresent go-tos. Just a plain unseasoned steak.", "useful": 1, "cool": 0, "user_id": "zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg", "review_id": "UHfX2vGy61-5orToD4e5kw"}, {"date": "2017-11-21", "stars": 1, "funny": 0, "business_id": "KuDrIPWUqn2NVb6M09lZLQ", "text": "If you are looking for a doctor for your immigration exams, this is not a right place.

At the time, I had only one dog and the service each time we went was decent. However, in the four years I've been going there, we've NEVER seen the same doctor twice. \n\nI now have a second dog, and took him to AV for a semi-severe case of demodex. They prescribed a topical treatment, antibiotics, and shampoo--nearly $300 in meds. Treatment did not work, and we returned after several weeks, after noticing his condition was actually worsening. At his follow-up, they prescribed him ivermectin, and we were given NO WARNINGS of potential side effects, other than diarrhea or vomiting. OUR DOG WENT COMPLETELY BLIND WITHIN ONE WEEK OF TAKING THE MEDICINE. \n\nWhen I took him in to figure out why he was now BLIND, the owner of the establishment came to speak to me, and did not offer so much as an apology for his staff not explaining the potential risks of the medication. Instead, he asked me why I waited so long to bring the dog in, asked if I had considered something else made him go blind (he's a puppy, less than a year old, and showed no signs of vision loss or impairment prior to the invermectin treatment), and--when I referenced ivermectinfordogs.net which says the drug should never be prescribed to German Shepherds, puppies, or mixed breeds, he said, \"Are you even sure he's a German Shepard?\" Instead of owning up to his staff's mistake, it was as if I was in a court room arguing legal responsibility with someone who's obviously been down the lawsuit road before. He literally told me, \"If we took the time to explain all the potential side effects, we wouldn't have time to see the other patients, and no one would ever buy any medicine.\" I didn't need a three hour consultation. I needed a piece of paper that says, \"YOUR DOG COULD GO BLIND FROM TAKING THIS.\" The consumer deserves a right to make an educated decision based on the risks and benefits of any drug. I was never given that opportunity. \n\nAt the very least, own up to your negligence. At least pretend to have compassion for our situation, that our puppy is now blind. Don't accuse me and try to shift blame. \n\nLike the other reviews I'm reading, I could go on for pages. In a separate incident from what's written above, my 14-year old dog had blood in her urine and I called the vet in a panic (as this was not the first time it'd happened), was told they were \"very busy\" and that a doctor \"would call me soon.\" No one ever called me back. I used to spend THOUSANDS of dollars a year at this place, and no one can even return a phone call.\n\nTheir hours are great, which is probably the only thing keeping them open. They are overpriced, unorganized, and generally seem to have a lack of genuine concern for their patients. While there are a couple staff members who seem to actually have a passion for what they do, the owner is not one of these people, and his primary objective is to make money--even if it means cutting corners that ultimately his patients end up paying for--sometimes with their lives, or in our puppy's case, with his sight.", "useful": 0, "cool": 0, "user_id": "xY_X_uz4fXrY_g3DJ0TzNQ", "review_id": "Pw7hGIl6Oe_Q6Z-yrV17FQ"}, {"date": "2013-03-02", "stars": 3, "funny": 0, "business_id": "7xHbnGo4MXFkBm6gYSu_xg", "text": "This is a good pizza joint.  its kinda odd cause the tables and atmosphere are some what \"fast food\" feeling, if you order a soda they bring you a 20 oz plastic bottle and a red dinner glass of ice, they have a nice selection of beer ( thankfully in a glass made of glass).  the food is great though.  the wings are the bomb, the salads good and the pizza very tasty, again plastic cafeteria style plates.

This hospital themed restaurant offers an experience you won't soon forget. From the nurses to the pill bottle vodka shots it stays on point 365 days a year. The service however is a bit uncomfortable with what feels like teenage girls in skimpy nurse outfits serving you. Of course the men will still look but it gets weirder when you realize you have the option to be spanked by these young girls. My thoughts on the food are pretty basic and extremely unhealthy. The menu includes the Quadruple Bypass Burger, Quintuple Bypass Burger, Sextuple Bypass Burger, Septuple Bypass Burger, and the Octuple Bypass Burger. These dishes range in weight from half a pound to four pounds of beef. Also on the menu are Flatliner Fries (cooked in pure lard) and the Coronary Dog, Lucky Strike no filter cigarettes, alcohol, Butterfat Milkshakes and full sugar Coca-Cola. For the money you're investing in this meal it is not really worth it for the plain tasting food. My opinion is the Heart Attack Grill is a place that's fun only to say that you've been. However this restaurant is not for the faint of heart. Their moto is \"Eat, Drink, and Smoke their way to Better Health\". But from the overpriced food, inappropriate theme and the fact they lure people over 350lb to come eat free. I think it's best to just keep your distance.

It is located inside the CrossIron Mills Outlet Mall in the fashion neighborhood.  \n\nMy girlfriends and I were shopping around for dresses when it hit 8:10PM; it was just that time to find somewhere to eat.  We were going to pass by South St. Burger Co. and I was kind of craving some NY fries and a burger so we hit up this cool joint.\n\n The mall closes at 9PM during the weekdays so I felt bad going in and ordering because they started to clean up.  We were greeted by a friendly girl to take our order.  They offer burgers, salads, fries, onion rings, shakes, regular drinks and ice cream!  You can make a combo which comes with fries and a drink or switch it up for additional costs.  I went with the cheese burger and poutine (~$13).  Mary went with the same as me but with a drink and Anna went with a cheese burger.  The great thing is you have the option to have your burger on a whole wheat or white bun.  The greater thing is you get to choose exactly what you want for toppings and sauces.  For toppings they offer pickles, banana peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, red or cajun onions, cucumbers, olives and for sauces, they've got mustard, spicy or regular ketchup, horseradish, guacamole, mango chutney, hot pepper or regular relish, garlic (mmm) or wasabi mayo, hot sauce, chipotle bbq or regular bbq sauce! \n\nThere was a little bit of a wait as the burgers are grilled to order so we had a seat and they called us up when our order was ready so we didn't have to stand around.  When we got our food, we had a seat and carefully unwrapped the burgers.  You know your burger is good when you're MMMMMMing before you even bite the burger and you continue to MMMMM while you eat the burger.  FYI: There is no MSG, fillers or preservatives in the beef burgers we had and they're 1/3 lb, 100% pure beef tasty goodness!  Moving on to the poutine (which was also amazing, as per usual), the fresh cut fries were hot and crispy, the gravy covered the cheese curds perfectly...it was just divine.   We all agreed the burgers and poutines were really, really good and we would definitely come back again.\n\nThe service was as good as if they just opened.

There were a lot of other \"Grouponites\" dining and the restaurant clearly was not prepared for the crowd.  There was no hostess up front and we waited about 5 min. before someone came to seat us.  We were told that we could pick from a booth and someone would bring our menus.  We sat down and got our menus when they told us our server would be right with us.  A server approached our table and said, \"I'm here to get your drink order and your server will be right with you\".  So, apparently she was not the designated server for our table but she came back with our drinks and we were ready to order so she took our order and ended up becoming our server.  Number one pet peeve of ours is when we order an appetizer and it comes out at the same time as our food.  This happened.  My husband ordered wings and a Dip and I ordered the blackened tilapia sandwich.  My two kids split a kids meal.  My fish sandwich was far from blackened. It appeared to be thawed out and thrown on a grill for about 2 minutes and put on a sub roll that was not toasted or anything. It ended up being soggy.  I did not get the lettuce, tomato and onion as the menu described.  I waited for about 5 minutes to flag someone down because I didn't want to start eating it until I had dressed it up with the tomato, lettuce and onion.  So, the manager came by and got it for me.  My husband had way too much food and did not finish it.  The dip was mediocre at best but he did say the crispy chicken wings were good.  I just cannot believe my fish sandwich came out soggy on an untoasted roll that appeared to be a French's roll from the grocery store.  I would not be surprised if that fish was previously frozen and thawed in a microwave.  Our server (who was probably a hostess or food runner) was doing several other jobs was probably assigned to our table because the regular server in that station was slammed.  Isn't the whole point of Groupons to intice new customers and hope for repeat business? Well, that won't be the case with us.

A group of co-workers and I went there after work just so we could enjoy the patio.  We knew to arrive early on a Friday, or you can't get a table outside.  We are teachers and get off early, so we are able to get there around 3:30 pm.  We proceeded to enjoy very nice cocktails and good food out on the patio over the course of a few hours.  We had more people meeting us and were happily relaxed when we were asked by the bartender to give up our table and move inside.  Mind you we had spent about $100.00 between us and the new people meeting us planned to eat and drink as well.  \n\nWe were caught off guard and asked why we needed to move, it's not like we weren't ordering drinks, and we were told that people were waiting for the table and they have a 90 minute seating limit on the patio.  This is not posted anywhere in the restaurant and we were not told this when we were sat.  We asked what would happen if we didn't care to move and the bartender said she was just doing her job and a meaner \"boss lady\" would have to come over.  We spotted the owner and asked her to come speak with us.  She quickly confirmed that she asked the bartender to ask us to leave the table and when we suggested that she post the 90 minute seating rule, she came back with \"I don't have time for this\" and walked away.  \n\nI am summarizing this conversation because we spent several minutes trying to understand where this rude, cold, ridiculous customer service was coming from.  All I can figure is we didn't have on gold attire and she felt we weren't important enough customers.  The funny thing is, we have gone there in the middle of winter when the place is empty and spent money when the golfers weren't around.  \n\nAs she walked away, we did let her know that we had ordered more drinks and never received them.  She did not acknowledge the comment.  When we were leaving she pulled a member of our party aside and said that our drinks weren't served becasue we were cut off.  Then the owner proceeded to put her hand in our friends face.  I have never experience this kind of thing before and will never go back.  If 3 drinks over the course of 21/2-3 hours gets you cut off, even after you have ordered and eaten dinner then she's right, this isn't the place for me.

Yeah, breakfast at a saloon. That's a new concept, eh? Usually ya go get breakfast after ya hit the saloon. Anyway...\n\nI'm so thankful that the building where Jamie's Restaurant (our original destination the other night) was demolished or else I might not have ever stopped by this blustering bar/restaurant that I keep forgetting exists. \n\nDisclaimer: Maaannnn, is this joint clamourous. It was so much so, that I asked Kay if she wanted to go somewhere else when we walked in, but she stuck it out, much to my relief. The food here is good enough to overcome the noise. Not that it was a rowdy place Nor were we subjected to any foul language, fights, or fatuous behavior. It's just LOUD but jovial nonetheless. There was a party going on in the dining room, which is where we were seated, and the folks didn't seem to mind at all despite not knowing us -- they were cool with it, so we were too. The people in the dining room and bar did not appear to be derelicts in any sense of the word. As a matter of fact, the clientele ranged widely in age. I saw an elderly couple, a middle-aged woman with her two teenagers, and of course many 20 and 30-somethings, all of them dressed casually without slumming it,  everyone seemingly enjoying themselves in a civil manner. To me Cain's did not come off as a dive or pick-up joint but rather appeared to be a friendly neighborhood watering hole and eatery. Bear in mind, however, that we stopped in between 8 and 9PM on a Friday night. Perhaps it gets a little wilder as the night moves along. The name Cain does have some Biblically ominous weight to it after all. Luckily, I wasn't named Abel! \n\nTwo appetizers lifted us off the runway: Honey BBQ Wings and Fried Oysters. \n\nThe supple wings had a mildly sweet, mildly rich sauce that coated them lavishly. The oysters were the culinary school example of apt deep frying, retaining their salty, seaborne flavor and juicy, slick constitution after a plunge into the hot fat, the crispy breading staying in place. \n\nCain's offerings include the usual sandwiches, burgers, wings and bar food, along with 14 different salads, all of which really sounded interesting (hello Watermelon Feta!). If that's not enough, they also have steak (T-Bone, New York Strip, aged sirloin tips) seafood (calamari, cod, crab legs, shrimp, the aforementioned oysters), pasta (fettuccine), hot turkey, and a Dessert of the Day, which we didn't partake in (we wanted to try nearby Carini's for ice cream). \n\nOnce I saw the Crab and Lobster Roll on the menu, all of the other choices before me were discarded. \n\nWhen freshly chopped lobster tail and legit jumbo-lump crab meat are chilled and married inside a toasted hoagie bun... alright, cue that insipid, forced Metallica ballad from the Black *hack* sell-out *hack* Album. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcbAibPA2yY\n\nI've always HATED that song, but back to the hero at hand..\n\nUmmm...yeah, lettuce, tomato, and red onion are included to keep you regular. I asked for mayo since that's how I get down. There is something quite spectacular about a sandwich that bridges creamy, hot, and cold, especially when seafood is involved, even when it's just tuna salad on an English Muffin. Cain's roll of crab and lobster is the one to beat in my league thus far. \n\nThe Warm German Potato Salad I chose as my side could have easily passed for bacon-strewn, onion-laden, vinegary home fries; a deception I would find most welcome. Besides, french fries and onion rings do get tiresome. I still stand by my preferred creamy, cold, deli-style tater salad, but Cain's WGPS made for a fine culinary detour. \n\nKay's Ahi Tuna Salad was a sight to be seen. A grand cut of grilled Ahi tuna sat arrogantly atop a bed of baby greens, diced tomatoes, chopped red onion, avocado pieces, quarters of hard boiled egg. After tasting a chunk of the tuna, I got the impression that someone back in the kitchen knows their way around the fire. \n\nAnd the service was terrific. We were made to feel like long-time regulars despite never having been there before.\n\nI know, I know, but resist I cannot.

Ok, I'll accept that but this new paper menu says \"$1.00 to add things like butter, jam...\"  I ask why he didn't charge me the $1.00.  He said I created a sandwich. I reminded him I come in once a week for my snackwich and what I pay.  He said if I didn't like it I don't have to take it.  Not very customer service oriented.  I just think that the \"chalk board\" menu and the paper menu should reflect proper prices.  I added cheese to a roll.  \n\nOk enough with the negative.  This place has awesome food.  From the Croque Madame to the Croque Monsieur.  These sandwiches are insanely tasty and are served with a small side salad and a great balsamic dressing.  The coffee/espresso is way better than any Starbucks or Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf you may enjoy.  They offer great sweet treats and quiche too.\n\nParking is pretty easy at this place.  They do have bike parking and an outdoor sitting area.  You could bring your pup to hang out while you eat your great meal.  \n\nTodays snafu won't stop me from coming here.

The gentleman at the entry gate asked what we were there for & after explaining we came to look, advised us that someone would be waiting for us when we parked. We met a lovely man, Mike Neder, who was new to the sales staff. He was closely followed by sales manager \"Joe\", who told Mike to take us to the truck area. So we walked to one truck, which didn't meet our requirements. Checked a couple of others, also not meeting specs. We were heading toward the office (where it was cooler!) for Mike to take notes on what we are looking for, when a golf cart with \"Ron (from Persia)\" pulled up. He'd been sent by Joe to take us to the trucks -- and, honestly, take over any sale! We drove to the back lot, where there were some F350s...none of which, again, met our reqs. And Ron was PUSH PUSH PUSH!!! My husband watched me go from zero to b*tch in less than 5 seconds (I become quite aloof & disdainful to the unsuspecting person), because I don't like to be pushed!!! (I also have over two years in the auto repair service & know my stuff, so don't tell me it's a flipping 8-foot bed WHEN IT'S NOT!!!) So Ron was pushing to sell the truck and I wasn't biting. DH & I did have a very nice test drive with Mike before heading back to the office -- where we were met by Ron. We sat at a table near the door & while Mike went to get some paper, Ron asked for the keys to our truck so he could have it \"appraised\". I flat-out said, \"No, you will not get the keys because we are not buying today & we'd made that abundantly clear when we arrived.\" He looked a bit taken aback, saying \"You aren't?\" to which I replied, \"We are not.\" Ron walked away, Mike came back & we left our specs with him. We didn't see Ron again.\n\n(Hubby had a similar experience with his keys at a dealership in WA -- and had to threaten the salesman with the police before he could get his keys back. Wasn't happening again on my watch! :P)\n\nEven though Mike was totally agreeable to work with, Earnhardt has lost our business -- simply because they disregard what the customer wants. (BTW, it is not your place to supersede us in that respect!) We emphasized more than once to Mike that we really don't want to be bothered with sales calls, and he assured us this will not happen, so we'll see how that goes. \n\nIt's a shame, though, that a potential customer loses interest in a business because their wants are forfeited to that business' needs. It's also a shame that a person simply can't look without being pressured by an overzealous salesperson -- even when that salesman recognized we were very specific about what we want.

I was under the impression the Sunday buffet was also on Saturday so we came here for brunch this past Saturday and were a little disappointed.\n\nThe menu was very limited for one thing and nothing stood out as being unique or exciting.  I tried the veggie sandwich that was to be served on cranberry walnut bread with some type of fancy cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, red peppers, onion marmalade and avocado.  Sounds good right?  Well it was good or would have been good but when it came out I was a little confused because it was an open-face sandwich piled high and impossible to eat.  You couldn't pick it up because it was too heavy and sloppy and to use a fork would have been defeating the purpose of having a sandwich--plus cutting into a thick piece of walnut bread wasn't exactly easy.  PLUS--I still couldn't get a taste of everything in one bite regardless.  It was just a mess.  It had great potential but poor execution.\n\nMy dining partner ordered the french toast and that is exactly what it was---a piece of french toast.  One piece.  On a high note it did have fresh fruit on top!  However, the syrup was dispersed for you (not offered at the table) and after about 3 bites it vanished.  It was likely a piece of texas toast battered and plated.  Why?  \n\nService was lovely, atmosphere is sexy, quality of food is decent but not satisfying in my opinion.  I would love to come back for the Sunday buffet and I will do that and update this review at that time!\n\nUntil then....don't go there for brunch on a Saturday---go right on down the street to zada janes and get MORE bang for your buck!!!

Due to it's proximity to my condo and the positive reviews I decided to give Soletta a try. Over the past few months I have used their services approximately 4 times (3 times for 'dry cleaning' and once for hemming). I don't know if the quality of their service has declined since the first 2 reviews were posted, but I will not be returning!\n\nOwners - Korean husband and wife team. Husband is a little standoffish, but not rude. Wife is a little more friendly in general, but rude if you want clothes re-washed (ie. when there are visible stains that were not on clothes prior to washing!)\n\nHemming - They did a good job with a Euro hem on my jeans. They are not the cheapest, but the quality is decent.\n\n'Dry Cleaning' - I would not recommend them for dry cleaning. 2 out of the 3 times I used them they had to re-wash my clothes (dress shirts both times) and were rude about it. The first time, I inspected my clothing before leaving the store and noticed that they did not remove food stains on my shirt - which before washing, they advised that it could be removed. I showed it to the husband and he said that he would have it re-washed. The second time, I noticed that there were 3 dark stains on my white dress shirt that weren't there when I originally brought them to Soletta. I complained to the wife and showed her the stains to which she yelled - \"You are the pickiest customer! So many people bring in their clothes to have cleaned and never notice anything wrong with them. Most people don't even check!\" It gets better...she tells me that they just wash and press shirts and that if I wanted them dry cleaned I should have gone elsewhere. I tell her that I thought all of my clothes were being dry cleaned, she said no. They only dry clean clothes if they see a stain and 'they can't always catch every stain'.\n\nIf you would like to pay someone to throw your 'dry clean only' clothes in to a washing machine and pay them for it, Soletta is for you!
