Because we were by the door, we began to feel like we were the official greeters, as there is not a hostess station.  Eager groups of diners entered and stood at our elbows, waiting (jostling) for a table.  After about 10 minutes, we fled our table for the wide-open bar.  Settling in, we realized that there was a true staffing problem.  The bar tender disappeared, never making eye contact with us.  About 5 minutes later, a bleached blond waitress entered the bar to get her orders.  My husband said \"hi\", she, quite surprised said \"hi\" back and proceeded to complete her order and exit.  We sat there in disbelief.  Looking at the menu, nothing made us say, \"wow, I would love to try that\".  We then came to the complete understanding (and conclusion) that we were not going to get the service that we deserved.\n\nWe left, walked across the parking lot to LOCAL BISTRO and HAD AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC MEAL AND EVENIING...but that is another review.

Although she did work at Stampede we actually took the time to work around both our schedule. One thing I like about Stampede is that there is always returning food vendors and new food to try out! Yes Stampede can and will drain your money but if you don't gamble to win it back then you would need to budget yourself. The best place to gamble would be at Over and Under, although there are other places to gamble O&U is the number one hot spot. \n\nIf you plan your visit properly you can cover a lot of ground on a half day (starting at 3 or 4pm) from shows to rides to games to food yes there are A LOT of things to do but it's always about the timing and the line ups.

I love when a restaurant uses this week to pull me in and entices me to come back the rest of the year...and George's did just that. First off, I loved the ambiance, the bar area with oysters and shellfish (which we admired from afar) and the curved dining room. I started with a Spicy Mule - which I can't decide if I liked or not. The spice was definitely there, but I think it was lacking some of the ginger beer flavor I would have liked more of. Off the RW menu we ordered the lobster bisque and the white wine mussels - the mussels won that round. Next up was the coq au vin and the beef bourginion - the coq au vin with the gruyere polenta won this match-up (if you're keeping score, so far my meal is beating my husband's.) Finally, for dessert, we'd selected the creme brulee and the chocolate cake (by a fancier name, even our server said, \"oh the chocolate cake\" as I struggled to pronounce it from the menu.) Finally my husband gets on the board with the creme brulee.\n\nWe'll be back, sooner rather than later, for their awesome Happy Hour deals in the bar.\n\nOh, a final note, after spiraling up, up, up the parking garage to finally find a spot, we discovered that George's valet is complimentary (or at least it was that night), so do some research and maybe save yourself the hassle of trying to park at Piedmont Town Center on a Friday evening.", "funny": 0, "review_id": "z9yuOgeCmzvi3LmLmpl1hA", "date": "2014-01-29", "user_id": "IwP_3dLp9z-t-JWYF8r6vA"}, {"business_id": "C3vERlSyOOUKL6Wt56G04g", "stars": 3, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "text": "I came here based on the reviews.\n\nIts clean inside, Kind of small. \n\nThe waiter was nice.

The evaluation and pre-care process is a bit arduous and time consuming but before you sign on the dotted line you should have a very clear idea of their philosophy, their way of operating and their expectations.  If you are expecting some kind of zen chiropractic experience you might want to keep looking. We had to fill out a questionnaire that was several pages long asking about physical health, mental health, overall health goals, etc.  We got xrays of our spine, got on a balance board thing that I believe showed right/left side balance and some other test with the nerves in our spine.  We had them evaluated and then went to a consultation about the results.  They then have you come to the facility and in great detail, tell you all about their modus operandi.  You get a tour, and can see exactly what you will do each time you come in. This is chiropractic care that connects spinal health to overall health.  Not just, I have a sore back and need adjustments.  But again, they will explain it all to you. \n\nA typical visit for us:  Check in with our key card, head over to the neck stretching \"thingy\" on the wall.  Sit on the red inflated balls on the chairs and go through the exercises they teach you (they can tell you the why, how, what, etc..).  You then go over to the adjustment table and get adjusted and then we put a weighted band around our head which helps with the adjustment and correct neck curvature, walk for 5 to 10 minutes with it on, then we are done.  We do this three days a week and yes, sometimes I just don't feel like going.  At a certain time into your care, you just come once a week and do the exercises at home with the equipment that you get in your home kit.  Actually, you do the home exercises even when going several times a week.  This care takes commitment and dedication but if you really are in this for the right reasons, you will do the work.  Do I fudge sometimes?  Absolutely!  But I do as much as I can.  There is dietary support like multi vitamins, supplements, powders, etc.  I haven't tried them yet so I can't speak to that.  What I have found since going is that I sleep better, after a few weeks of going I no longer woke up with clogged ears, I have increased energy and my spine just feels right!  What is feels right in scientific terms?  I have no clue.  Hubby is no longer complaining about constant lower back pain.  My daughter had serious hip pain that has subsided and the adjustments are helping her with her scoliosis.  Not a cure, just care.\n\nWe were able to do monthly payments for a family plan that we worked into our budget.  And they will work with you to find the best plan possible.  They give you so much information and are very transparent so you definitely go in with eyes wide open.  Not fancy, not zen, not traditional but if you google Maximized Living, they are a part of that network and that will give you a better idea of what you are in for.  Dr. Marc and his staff know their stuff and thus far we haven't been disappointed.  This is a place for care that goes beyond the spine and will teach you a lot about spine health and how its connected to overall health.  So if that intrigues you, pay them a visit and get the 411.

Some might argue that real Japanese restaurants don't focus on rolls, but rather on sashimi, it really comes down to what you want to eat and if a place satisfies that craving. \n\nFirst, the rolls here are HUGE, they do not skimp out on the rolls at all. This is not saying there's a ton of rice with a couple bits of fillers, no, the overall rolls is perfectly balanced, but massive in size. My particular favourite in-house specials would be the Toronto Roll, which is a giant roll topped with a giant amount of chopped sashimi, and the Osaka Roll, named after the establishment. The overall quality of fish is very consistent and fresh. \n\nThe service here can be on and off at times. When it isn't too busy, they are very attentive and efficient. However, the few experiences I had during peak ours (dinner service), the service has been a bit sporadic, with a number of empty uncleaned tables and a long line of eager customers.

The concept here is more fast food  than fine dining with choice of making your own pizza ($15 avg), pastas, salads- fountain drinks and wine by the glass or bottle (good selection). \n\nI asked the head chef what was his feature pizza for pizzafest, he seemed stumped. He looked around at his colleagues and then said,\" well it's hard too explain- there is a white cream sauce base and some other ingredients\". I was puzzled and kind of disappointed - you guys are a pizza shop! You should be able to explain your feature pizza ingredients to clients! \n\nSo I settled for a goat cheese pizza with fresh mozzarella, salami, sun dried tomatoes, caramelized onions and spinach \u00e0 la Nona. The pizza was a decent size easy to share or eat on your own. I found the base crust to be super soggy so none of the toppings were holding -and the tomatoe sauce was tart. My dad owned a pizzeria - I know my pizza- I have had 99 cents pizza better than this. On top of that all- the pizza was served cold - since a server delivered our order giving us a number at a table. The complimentary olive oil and chili flakes (not spicy at all) were a nice touch to each table.\n\nAlso the female bathrooms were out of order-not the best bet for a restaurant.\n\nWeak pizzafest2017 contender, on to the next location!", "funny": 0, "review_id": "UK-6mnemyIZ3AgtEC0GcVw", "date": "2017-09-13", "user_id": "g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w"}, {"business_id": "vqG1Z2XpS_PryPsfY0CSng", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "text": "As a business traveler, it is very important for me to rely on restaurants that provide consistent high quality food and service, and also cater to the local clientele.

But don't be fooled. You'll see people from every walk of life enjoying a meal here.\n\nFor as little as $7 you can get a small Pho bowl to fill you up (unless you haven't eaten in days don't buy an XL Pho). My wife and I started off with some veggie spring rolls. Not too oily, crunchy and perfectly paired with their homemade Sriracha that's present at every table. My wife and shared the veggie and seafood Pho as well as the Chicken Satay Pho. The veggie seafood Pho came with fresh beansprouts and basil that smelled so delightful and tasted so fresh that I thought I was back in Hanoi where we first discovered authentic Pho. The Chicken Satay Pho had just the right amount of spice but the homemade Sriracha enhances the taste if you like spicy. Many Pho places I've been to brings their bowls out steaming hot and you are left waiting a long time before it's cool enough to eat. Not at Lac Vien. The temperature is just right.\n\nI've gotta stress again that prices where super reasonable. For coffee, tea, appetizers and copious amounts of high quality Pho for two, our bill came out to $25.99\n\nFinally I had the hot coffee with condensed milk.

I've found a couple places that I love, a few that I like, and a ton that were just not good. I was delighted to find a small Bouchon Bakery stand in the Venetian when I was in Vegas last. I saw a ton of macarons and I knew I just had to try them.\n\nMACARONS.\nHmm... well, I've had better. Collectively, the macarons were just okay. Individually, some were better than others. I went to Bouchon thirty minutes before they closed and realized they didn't have many macarons left in the display. I asked if they had more in the back, and the girl working there said they do but they're in a set of six. I thought to myself, this was perfect! I wanted to try a bunch of flavors anyway. So I ended up paying around $20 for six macarons. Crazy right?! Usually I pay around $25 for a dozen. But hey, when in Vegas. \nI noticed immediately after my first bite that the macarons that were pre boxed were not very fresh. I could tell because the macaron completely crumbled after one bite, which is usually because they've old. Fresh macarons (24-48 hours) are typically crisp on the outside but are chewy on the inside. Though the outside shell can be crumbly, the whole thing shouldn't just collapse. The macarons were either old or they weren't made properly.\nRegardless, I tried every flavor. My favorites were the chocolate, coffee and vanilla. The chocolate was filled with a rich chocolate ganache. The coffee was strong but in a good way, the way it should be in a macaron. The vanilla was light and it cleansed my palette after the strong (delicious) coffee macaron I had just before it. The strawberry tasted funky to me... kind of like a flower. I don't know how to describe it, but I didn't like it. I find strawberry macarons are a bit tricky to get right, not unless you use fresh strawberry in the filling. The artificial flavors just don't cut it with this delicate french pastry. The pistachio was horrid... it was strong in flavor and was just too much for me to finish. I'm not a fan of pistachio, so maybe that's why. But if you love pistachio, you'll probably really enjoy this one!\n\nPRICE.\nAbout $20 for a box of 6 macarons is quite expensive. I realize this is Vegas and Bouchon Bakery is expensive, but dangggg! I think next time I'll come earlier in the day, make my own customized box of macarons, and call it a day. I'd be more satisfied with a box full of flavors I really like.\n\nOVERALL. Okay macarons, in my opinion. The price is way too much for what you actually get. I'm no cheapskate, but I know how much an 'okay' macaron should cost, and how much a GREAT should macaron cost. I paid too much for 'okay' macarons.", "funny": 7, "review_id": "McUeIP7fxx9tQsvo6d-TEA", "date": "2014-01-22", "user_id": "wKV3ZMdOe4b_yaPGTy8Igg"}, {"business_id": "EZdHp6hzzyU0R1Adb2VaGA", "stars": 4, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "text": "Very good.

I am sure the minds  that are behind creative culinary hot dogs can think of something better to do in lieu of generic soggy buns.\n\nThe fries were good, and you  would pay about the same thing as Wendy's or something of that nature, so thats a plus. \n\n\nCliff Notes Version: \"Meh\"", "funny": 2, "review_id": "FTWfjx0h7BkgCzcl2TL4YQ", "date": "2012-10-29", "user_id": "s_PI8eOGJdoYCIGCSmBN8Q"}, {"business_id": "Be2HA0nzvxXoavlumHjKWg", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 1, "text": "Great practice.

The trouble we had was with our mains , the Risotto was actually pretty bad they had burned shallots on top that were just bitter and my rigatoni were ok . However for some wine and a tasting sample of Mozzarella and antipasto I would highly recommend it .

It wasn't phenomenal, exceptional or stellar but ok.  I'm sure there are other menu options that may fall under those categories but my food was just ok. First let me say, the customer service was excellent. Every server spoke and were very friendly.  Now about the food, most of it lacked seasoning. I ordered the soul rolls as an appetizer and Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes that comes with two sides and cornbread for my entree. My sides were collards and mac n cheese but I ordered an extra side of yams.  The soul rolls didn't touch my soul; they lacked much flavor, probably because they were filled with too many ingredients (diced chicken, black eyed peas, collard greens and rice). The salmon cakes were 100% meat and not fillers, the only problem is that they fell apart when I attempted to eat them and they could've used more seasoning.  Their remoulade sauce was excellent though.  When I make salmon cakes at home, I use seasoning, (no shade) an egg and a little panko to bind them together. The \"gourmet greens,\" (which I've named them) were cute and tasted ok minus the toppings. I've never seen diced tomatoes and onions garnished on top of collard greens.  The mac n cheese was cold and had chunks of cheese curds in it. The yams were very yummy, they were baked firmly and not mushy.  For dessert, I ordered the banana pudding cake. It was very moist and delicious, not overly sweet but they put banana chips in there which I didn't like. They had an abundance of freshly made cakes which looked absolutely delicious. They had: sweet potato, lemon, coconut, chocolate banana pudding, strawberry and another one that I can't remember.

I'm the type of foodie that will pay whatever the amount for good food, but I dont agree paying for a $20 salad that isn't out of this world. \n\nFirst time I went I got a Wolfe Bowl Salad and I was soooooo disappointed. Cashier said it was the most popular salad but I beg to differ. The Tameri dressing was so over powering and literally everything was drenched in salad dressing. Im a sauce person so Im all about it but this one was just so wrong. I dont understand why arugula and kale would be paired together, the taste of the two together was so bitter I barely touched the salad. This salad tasted very grainy and my teeth and jaw were so tired of chewing all the hard brown rice that was in it. DId not like it at all\n\nSecond time I ordered a Mexican salad. Lettuce, black beans, tomatoes, torilla chips and a cilantro dressing. It was very basic and I would not be trying that one again. This time the kitchen barely put any dressing on so everything just tasted very bland and dry. \n\nThird time I ordered a Miso Hungry salad. Lettuce, rice noodles, red peppers, edamame, miso dressing and avocado. dressing was light and flavorful, textures of the salad could have used a little more crunch. Overall it was a good salad but the KITCHEN FORGOT THE DAMN AVOCADOS!! At this point I had already returned to my office and it was too cold to go back. I was so angry, out of all the ingredients to forget they forget the best one!!!\n\nIf you want to eat healthy and feel very \"posh\" then Mandy's is your place.

I've been wanting to go, but I don't usually find myself at Downtown Summerlin. I finally got to see for myself how wonderful this restaurant is & what the hype was about. Me & my friends came in for dinner. \n\nAtmosphere blew me away! Modern, clean, & dim. I didn't think the restaurant was that big. We were given 3 options to dine: bar, booth, or patio. We chose a booth, & I was surprised to see a wall outlet in our booth as well as 2 USB ports. The interior was amazing which made me reminisce about grade school. Booths were set up to look like study booths. Overhead, had models of planets, & there was a wall in front of us that had books. Our dinning area definitely reminded me of a library. & of course, they have free WiFi too. Behind me was the kitchen which looked like a school cafeteria. The menus were composition notebooks, & the check was on a mini clipboard. Napkins looked like binder paper notepads. I haven't checked what the bar looked like, but the patio gave a really nice view & you could play a couple games too like a giant connect four, beer pong, or sandbag toss.\n\nFood was a little on the pricey side, but it's what you would expect from a fancy outlet mall like Downtown Summerlin. I ordered the Thai Shrimp Noodle Salad which was a pretty big portion. I took a bite & it immediately rushed throughout my mouth with flavor. I was impressed. My friend ordered the tacos. The meat in those tacos were also very flavorful. & my other friend ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich which he said was pretty good. The French fries were deliciously, & the ketchup had an interesting taste. A little spicy kinda like mixing ketchup with Sriracha. We got a ice cream cookie sandwich for dessert. It's surprisingly really big, & was able to satisfy the 3 of us. Cookies were soft with sweet chocolate chips in them. The vanilla ice cream prevented the chips from being too sweet. & the crunch on the outside added a nice texture. I liked the overall quality of the food, & it justified the price. \n\nStaff service was excellent! It's not everyday you get greeted by the general manager which surprised me. I didn't get his name, but apparently, they have new management? I don't know how it was before compared to now, but I think it's great now! Our server was Lissie, & she's just adorable. Haha. Very nice & always had a sincere smile on her face. Very helpful & knowledgeable in explaining dishes & drinks as well as giving us recommendations.

Charged me an extra $80.00 for a \"deodorizer\" that did not work. At first, when he was done, it looked like he may have gotten the job done well. I would encourage anyone having their carpets cleaned to wait to have an opinion until they are DRY. \n\nOnce the carpet was dry, it didn't look like anything had been done at all. These guys charged me $300.00 for the quick and dirty - and I absolutely gave them a chance to fix it. \n\nWhen I called the owner to tell him that he had done a less than satisfactory job, he stated that he couldn't control pet stains from older dogs. Um. My puppy was six months old and the spots were fresh. He basically told me to pound sand. He had collected his money and didn't care about what he left behind. \n\nHis competitor got them right out - because he knew what he was doing. Then the competitor explained to me what he (Done Your Way) had really done: he had flooded my carpets with water to make them appear clean. This was why it took so long for them to dry. Had I not had them redone, I could have ended up with mold. Not to mention the spots would still be there. \n\nAvoid this fly by night company at all costs. Eventually he's going to run out of steam in this area.

The Pigs in a Blanket contained a local favorite Schreiners sausage wrapped in flaky crisp pastry with bacon, pinto beans and pico, the flavor was exceptional.\n\nSmaller Plates, I had the \"Lobstah Mac and Cheese\", I have never been impressed with a Mac and Cheese dish until now. The \"Lobstah Mac and Cheese\" dish was exceptional. The cheese which had the flavor of a Dublin cheddar was complimented by the infused herbs and crowned with a piece of Lobster cooked to perfection.

The Chicken and Waffles was great but the Steak & Frites were exceptional. I had the Filet Mignon cooked Medium-Rare and it did not disappoint. The flavor of the steak combined with the red wine sauce and texture of the meat was mouthwatering, needless to say all the steak was cleared.

First, you should know I hardly ever do company reviews, but they were so awesome I had to! Second, if you want excellent customer service, with no problems - go to them!\n\nI emailed them on Wednesday (a day I didn't realize they were closed) for a quote about my macbook lcd and glass being broken and needing to be replaced.  Even though there office was closed, I still got an email from a real person that explained they were off but to bring it in so they can evaluate and give me an estimate.

These guys, at Mac Masters, really are mac masters, and who else would you trust to work on your computer?  And the cherry on top, the ultimate selling point to this additional $100......... they told me they had the parts in stock (which many others have to order) and they could have my laptop fixed by that same night or the next morning.

Excellent. Of course, I might just be remembering Vinnie's, and they've done a great job reimagining the place. It looks great. Staff up front is fiendishly friendly as well.\n\nOn the downside, the bar can get incredibly loud if you're there at the wrong time, which is to say if they are busy and you really don't want to be in a bar, but would rather just sit and have a nice dinner. The problem with this is that there are a few tables in the bar section, which is where they may seat you. Fine if you want to sit in a bar, but not so much if you want dinner.\n\nI will certainly second the popcorn that is brought out with a nice kick to it - very cool, and something you don't often see (I'm sure it's cheaper than bread too, but that doesn't really matter). The only problem is that there isn't a great way to get it out of the basket and onto the plates they give you - not a good choice if you're at a large table of people who don't really know each other. Having bowls or spoons or something would help here, and speaking of large table, we went through that popcorn in no time flat, and it was never refilled. Even chips at a lower-end Mexican place get refilled, so not sure if it usually is or if we hit them on a bad night, but we didn't see any more popcorn.\n\nThe menu was actually really interesting, but poblano cheese served with house-made chips had great flavor, coupled with a strange consistency to the cheese made things seem really off. On the plus side, we ran out of chips on this dish, and those were replenished quickly. Guess they had more chips, but not more popcorn. The poppers were odd - you take a bite, and half of the breading falls onto the plate, while a large chunk of pepper remains in your mouth, and most of the cheese drips onto the plate in the form of grease. Not the best presentation I've seen, though the sauce was good.\n\nOddly enough, the drinks were also refilled quickly - water, sodas, even beer. Maybe it was just the popcorn, but even dishes from the kitchen came out rather slowly, giving an overall impression of slowness to the whole night.\n\nWhen the main courses finally came out, it was a haphazard arrangement. The pork was a chunk of meat - and I don't mind a bunch of pork now - but little else, served in a bowl. Why serve a big chunk of meat in a bowl, with no bread or anything? Sure, you get a side, and that's okay, but a plate would be a much better choice. Corn (off the cob) is also served in a bowl, with no spoons, so getting it out with a fork is a challenge, and though there is spice available with sides, such as sriracha by itself or with ranch, it's charged per serving (and they don't mention this up-front, which is annoying). Flavors are good, but a bit on the bland side. Even \"crispy\" fries really aren't.\n\nIt may have been an off night, but I'm not sure I'll give them a try again soon.", "funny": 0, "review_id": "68WpeHpdE33f_WRaHxjqpQ", "date": "2014-03-20", "user_id": "62GNFh5FySkA3MbrQmnqvg"}, {"business_id": "pF_gxyS76K39-nuu3P7okw", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "text": "Quite possibly the nicest golf course staff in Clark county \nCourse is always in good shape for the number of rounds played \nRestaurant and clubhouse offer excellent values \nOnly negative about the place are the prima Donna residents who think they own the joint \nHey idiots.

Another friend wanted a \"3,\" and he was warned that his meal would be VERY SPICY... and it was according to his watery eyes, running nose, and request for more rice to dilute some of the taste.

After a good 5mins, I've finally decided to go with the Malaysian curry chicken. When it arrived, I thought to myself, that is one sad looking dish. All it had was a few chunks of chicken breast and 3 pieces of semi-cooked potatoes with rice. No greens, no veggies, nada. Just straight up carbs and protein. I know better to never judge a book by its cover but after the first bite, I'm judging alright and it was not good.

It reminded me a lot of some of the automated sushi snack bars I would frequent in Tokyo.\n\nRising from the ashes of a closed Tim Horton's (it moved a few blocks over behind an Esso), It looks like Peter Kinjo, formerly of Sakuna Grill, had a definate idea of what he wanted in his place.

Definately that.  \n\nIf you're wondering what I mean about that, Peter Kinjo is definately a tireless self-promoter.  Always ready with a joke or two, or a box of Pocky, he lights up a table whenever he's around to tease a diner, charm the girl or bring a laugh to a kid's face.  (I wonder if this is from his days at Sakuna since Teppanyaki chefs also tend to be jokers).  Sometimes admittedly it can be a bit much, and his pure force of personality can overwhelm a little (I ended up with 3-4 boxes at one dinner even though I HATE Pocky... but just couldn't bring myself to say no... luckily there were some kids in the resto who got extra Pocky from me as a result when his back was turned).\n\nSo overall, it's popular, and the food is good.

The reason for my 2 stars today is all due to the service I just experienced for our server JILLIAN.  Where do I even start!?\n\nAs we were being seated by the sweet hostess, I noticed a young blonde girl sweeping by our table.  After being seated and looking at the menu for 3 or so minutes, that same girl who was sweeping came to our table.  She NEVER gave us her name, just asked what we wanted to drink.  Now I have been a server and a bartender at many places and I know the Universal Steps of Service!! Always start by being polite and saying Hello, my name is.... Come on! Common Sense!!! Anyway, she took our drink order and came back with it.  I had water my friend had an Iced Tea.  She forgot to bring a lemon with it.  That is also common sense.  She didn't try to up sell beverages.  Normally you ask, would you like to start off with a pepsi, ice tea, or an ice cold beer etc. but this was not even offered to us.  She then took our order and walked off.  I noticed that there was only one silverware wrap-up on the table and she did not notice it.  I waited to see if she would catch that.  Our food was delivered by a food runner and that food runner didn't catch the 1 silverware roll up either so I stood up and grabbed one from another table.  The food runner, also female said nothing to us. She did not ask if we had everything, if we needed anything, or to even enjoy our meal.  Jillian, was no where to be found.  We had our food for about 5 minutes before she even came over to see if we were okay or if the food was cooked correctly.  Well, my fries were a bit cold but I let it slide.  Our drinks ran low, so I pushed my glass toward the end of the table with hopes she would see it.  As she stood with her arms crossed against the wall I started to get mad.  Everybody knows when a drink is half full you refill it, but mine was completely empty. As she stood against the wall looking around I wondered how she did not \"see\" this.  As she walked to the back to avoid us I stood up and POURED MY OWN WATER from a pitcher that was by us.  YES, I poured my own water.  As I did this a server named ALEX came over and he was so polite and sweet.  He asked us if we were okay and if we needed anything.  He grabbed my friend more ice tea and he then bussed our table and took the dishes we weren't using all while our own sever Jillian watched him.  She is something else.  \n\nBeing a server is a team effort.  I would be livid if I had to pick up the slack for a lazy server who clearly was hating her life that day and who showed she did not want to be there.  So, with that said, I asked Alex what her deal was.  He said she was upset because her guest had been stiffing her or tipping poorly all day.  WELL I WONDER WHY!! Now comes the best part, she asked if we wanted desert then dropped our check off.  Her name was on the check so that is the only way I got her name.  I asked for a manager and relayed all of this to her as well.  The manager was extremely responsive and helpful.  She offered to do something for us but I said no.  I was not looking for a hand out just good service.  I told her that Jillian's poor attitude and lack of serving skills makes their place look bad and I just wanted to address the issue so Jillian's attitude could be adjusted for her next set of patrons.  Our bill was $29.00 so we left Jillian $3.00.  That is more than she deserved clearly.  Since I am in the Vegas service industry I just couldn't leave nothing.  I get it, we work for tips and that is our sole income.  But as I walked out I did hand Alex a $20 tip for being so polite and helpful.  He deserved it.  Now, the kicker of this whole experience..... as we left Jillian yelled out, \"ADIOS\" in a snide tone.   Are you kidding me!! How old are you!? So I asked again for the same manager and told her about that as well.  That is seriously uncalled for.  If I was Jillian's manager I would have sent her home to adjust her attitude.  I hope you are reading this Jillian because this is NOT how your treat your customer unless you want to get getting Zero to 10%tips.   Take some notes from Alex!\n\nAll in all I do love this spot.  The food is yummy and I haven't had a bad server experience until tonight.  Yes, I will return but you best believe I will not sit in Jillian's section again.  I'll save my $20 for the next server.", "funny": 1, "review_id": "09IxHp30twX_51s2y0Nf3Q", "date": "2012-11-25", "user_id": "seh1_Whauw3PkES5CXvS1Q"}, {"business_id": "HK3wV8AiEmYAohIW13FoYQ", "stars": 5, "cool": 0, "useful": 0, "text": "I am shocked!

From the minute we started the conversation with the clerk, she was trying to up-sell all the services. We made a reservation of a compact car (to save some money) and she was pushing us to upgrade one level to Kio Soul which she claimed to be 4-wheel drive. I am a car guy but not too familiar with this specific model. So I believed in her to upgrade to this option with 4 wheel drive because we were driving from Vegas to Zion and Bryce nation parks which was in icy condition. It turned out what she said is not true. Later I looked up the spec for this model and it's a FRONT WHEEL DRIVE car. \n\nApart from this, couple of things need your attention(not saying what they do are wrong...). First, they would ask you where you are driving to. Since we were going to Utah for Zion and Bryce, they will charge you for extra mileage expense which is around $35 per day. This sounds fair to us. Secondly, we brought our personal auto ins policy with us and the policy has full coverage (liability, comprehensive, collision, tow..) but this does not always cover all the expense if something happens. They will charge you for LOSS of USE if the rental car needs to sit in the repair shop and can't generate money for them. Even though all other expense except deductible is covered by your full coverage ins policy, this LOSS of USE is not covered. Therefore, this is another $28 per day. These two points are not showing they are doing something wrong but just reflecting their work ethics- getting any penny out of you.\n\nThe part of lying on the car feature to get us upgraded really makes us so angry. We'll never come back for their business even though they offer the lowest original rental price like this time.
