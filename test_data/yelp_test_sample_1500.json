The lineup has been phenomenal and non-stop so far and the location is great. I plan on seeing Phantogram as my third show there so far. \nI must also establish, though, that being under 21 at this venue absolutely sucks. First, you're sent to a back entrance after you get your ticket validated at the front entrance where you see people eating great food and having a great time outside. Upon entering through the back, you have three choices: go straight into the Kiddie Corral that makes up 1/4 of the whole crowd area, hang out in the dark bathroom, or check out the merch table. When I saw St. Vincent at Crescent Ballroom, I literally stood in the same spot for 30 minutes just so I could get a decent view of Annie. I couldn't move because it was so crowded and if I did move, the only view I would be able to get would've been the back of the drummer's head. Also, where I was standing, the sound was really distorted since the speakers were right above and in front of us. Everyone was wincing and plugging one of their ears to bear it; It was way too loud at least in that instance. I saw Unknown Mortal Orchestra there a few weeks prior, though, and that sounded pretty great...but the crowd was a lot smaller and thus I wasn't stuck directly in the speaker's line of fire. \nI asked the two security guards at the back entrance 1. What do I do if I want something to drink other than water? and 2. What do I do if I want to get something to eat? To both questions, they answered, \"Just flag one of us security guards down, we'll take care of you.\" What, so I'm going to tell you I want something, you're going to leave your post to get me a menu, wait for me to choose, give my order to the kitchen, and then bring my food to me so I can eat it standing up in the corner of the Kiddie Corral? I don't think that's very logical, personally. \nI just don't understand the logic of the whole map of the place. If you're 21, I would imagine it's a fantastic experience, but I wouldn't know since I'm 18 and not allowed to see more than the upper left corner of the building. Oh, and there's no re-entry even though you're stamped and usually braceleted! It's almost unbearable when the whole place is unceasingly loud and dark and stuffed with people and there is only a corner of available space to merely move in.

But it was definitely bad enough that we will never be going back.\n\nFirst off, our waiter was very inexperienced, which is completely understandable with it being a new restaurant, but it was almost as if he hadn't been trained. He did know which beers were wheat beers (he offered us an IPA, which is most definitely not what we were looking for). He kept hanging around our table when we tried to politely make it obvious that we were not interested in having a conversation with him. After he delivered our appetizers he told us about the dinner menu after hearing from us twice that we only wanted a few small plates and beer, we weren't interested in dinner. He was very nice, but he could have used more training. \n\nHowever the food is the reason we won't be going back. We ordered their Smoked Paprika Garlic Smashed Cheese... Which was just cold chunks of butter and garlic! I'm not even sure it was real garlic and not just garlic powder! How were we expected to spread chunks of butter on the pretzels that accompanied the dip, I do not know. It was definitely not as advertised, I couldn't taste the paprika at all, I think they just added enough for some color.  As for the \"smashed cheese\", well I think they left the cheese in the kitchen. It was disgusting. How is this considered as signature item??\n\nWe also got the Parmesan Chicken Tenders, which were SO bland and quite dry. Does this place not know what salt and pepper are? The chicken tenders could have easily been acceptable with a bit of easy seasoning. The mustard that came with them was at the opposite end of the spectrum and absolutely overpowering.\n\nIf they can mess up on easy items that are just appetizers how can they possible manage to offer full dinner entrees?

On 9/1, I took my 11 year old maltese to see why she was losing so much weight. The first vet did a senior blood panel. On the 2nd, she left a message that had no sense of urgency with the results. When I called back, she told me Jazzy had diabetes, to start her on 1 unit of insulin (my third dog has been a diabetic for years so I knew what to do) and to bring her back in 7 days. But Jazzy wasn't eating so I gave her a half a unit so as not to drop her too low. The next day (the 3rd), she was not eating, drinking or getting up to greet me. I called and said I think it was time to put her down. I go in with her, thinking she's had diabetes for a lot longer than I thought and there was no option at this point. THAT is when the second vet I saw told me she had PANCREATITIS in addition to the diabetes AND a heart murmer! Why would the first vet not even tell me let alone tell me to rush her back in on Wednesday? Pancreatitis is very painful!!! \nNOW, we are dealing with early cataracts, cushings, diabetes, pancreatitis and a heart murmer but...the second vet says...it's possible she could recover well but tells me she'd support the decision to put her down. I was so incredibly torn and it was about the money. I only had about $2k left in savings and another dog at home who also has issues. I am left alone and when the vet comes back, I ask her much it would be to try and save her - she tells me $2200 - $2500. I am torn with what to do because I think I have to pay it THAT NIGHT. At no time, did this vet or any other person at the office tell me that they offered interest free payment plans for situations just as this. I found out when I called on 9/14 asking if my lil' girl's remains were back and heard it when they stuck me on hold. When they came back on - they said, \"Oh, yes... they've been here.\" BEEN THERE? Why wasn't I called that they were back? And why wasn't I told I HAD AN OPTION...ESPECIALLY WHEN I ASKED THE VET STRAIGHT AWAY! I was under the impression I had to pay everything up front at that precise moment. After the move here and everything being so expensive in Arizona, I wasn't willing to deplete the savings account because I had a third dog at home. I even told her their older brother passed on 6/11 from lung cancer after a year of battling it with chemo and I was not willing to lose another dog so soon! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? Why didn't you give me that option? I was absolutely willing to help her if it meant not depleting the savings account. I have a job - I could have paid it. I just didn't have it all THAT NIGHT when I thought I had to have it! HOW DARE YOU PUT ME IN THAT POSITION WHEN THERE WAS AN OPTION! I'm so sick of this new generation of incompetents. They just don't care. AT ALL. They all seem to think they can just make bad judgements and then just say sorry afterwards. IF YOU HAD GIVEN ME THAT OPTION and she didn't make it - At least I knew I tried. But you never gave me the option and I felt I had no choice. And then your office has the unmitigated gall not to even call me when her ashes were returned? I suppose I'm also to be a mind reader in addition to automatically knowing your policies and being a vet to know what she REALLY had? I have no words that can describe how utterly disgusted I am at those two vets and that practice overall. I am SICK TO MY STOMACH that I put my lil' girl down because no one told me the payment plan was an option. I said I wanted to talk to that vet. She has yet to call me. They wanted me to talk to the Office Manager. But the office manager wasn't available that night and didn't see me holding on to my lil' girl thinking I had no other option but to put her down and the office manager didn't race in to save the day. IT WAS UP TO THAT VET TO TELL ME WHEN SHE SAW ME SO DISTRAUGHT WITH THAT CHOICE. I haven't stopped crying since last night! That vet KNEW I was torn and that it was all over the money. She should have and could have said something...she chose not too. She didn't say, \"It's about $2k to $2500 but if it'll help, we have an interest free payment plan\" because if she did.... I WOULD NOT HAVE PUT MY LIL GIRL DOWN. Honestly - there are no good vets in Arizona. They all seem to think it rather a lax profession where mistakes are tolerated and apparently even encouraged.\nI honestly hope you two vets and every employee present that night all experience the heartbreak and remorse I now have to live with for the rest of my life and I hope it haunts you as bad.

Some of the beers on tap include NoDa Brewing Company, Wooden Robot Brewery, Triple C Brewing Co. and Wicked Weed Brewing.  They also have a great list of unique craft cocktails.  Many of the cocktails on their menu are old classics with a twist.  We learned that one of these concoctions, The Uptown Sour, intrigued a Marriott executive so much that he jumped on a plane so he could try it for himself!\n\nThe desire to use local ingredients can also be seen in their food.  We had a few of their appetizers (pretzel brioche, beef bone marrow, crispy oysters) which were all amazing.  We could tell that this group understands the importance of top notch service when the Director of Eat & Drink, Sean Potter, delivered our appetizers to our table providing us with an informative description of the ingredients and preparation techniques.  The staff was friendly, helpful and attentive.  I loved Stoke's open kitchen design which compliments the modern yet welcoming atmosphere very well.\n\nAlthough the restaurant is located within the Charlotte Marriott City Center, this is definitely not your average hotel restaurant.  Chef Chris Coleman is doing a fantastic job which has created national attention.  Stoke was listed on USA Today's Top 20 Restaurants to Try This Fall (2016) and that's a well-deserved accolade.

My wife had gone to this store earlier in the week and was told 6 balloons would cost $5. When I went to buy the balloons I was told a different story: $5 for helium, and 25 cents for each balloon. Suddenly, the price for 6 balloons was in excess of $7. I was also told that they might not have enough helium to fill the balloons I needed however the clerk managed to fill the balloons and I departed.\n\nAbout 5 hours after picking up the balloons they were clearly half their original size and terribly deflated. My wife went back to the store and was told that we had neglected to purchase the 50 cent per balloon \"treatment\", which would have made them last longer. My wife explained that no such service was offered, or explained as a possibility. The standoffish store owner offered to 'treat' the under-inflated balloons for 50 cents each however it seemed pointless to treat balloons that no longer floated in any way.\n\nThe store owner pointed to a sign that indicated TREATMENT: 50 cents, and basically told us tough luck. He even went a step further and called the employee, who served us, at home to get further details. The employee claimed she had no knowledge of any customer coming in and getting balloons filled. A little puzzling. It seems to me that employees should be trained to offer the 'treatment' service when filling balloons.\n\nLong story short: 6 deflated balloons that barely lasted 4 hours, for $7.50, and an owner that took no blame for his employee failing to mention what balloon 'treatment' was, instead pointing at a sign in a chaotic and cluttered store wall plastered with a myriad of signs.\n\nThis is clearly a store where the customer is treated with contempt and no basic courtesy. A part of my daughter's birthday was ruined because of this owner's greedy and neglectful behaviour. I will never shop at this store again, and I will advise anyone I know to avoid this store, and take their business elsewhere", "user_id": "bXBbeRqq9xSY2Tr3DvE5Yg", "review_id": "z6tfQBCBigmCbPicl3XeXg", "cool": 0, "business_id": "r28xbVOO89LJz46HGlkTAQ"}, {"useful": 7, "stars": 1, "funny": 0, "date": "2015-08-12", "text": "Since moving to AZ I wanted to find a mechanic that I could trust to do good work, stand behind the work they do, charge fare prices and be honest with me.  I read some Yelp reviews for Stamps and thought they might fit the bill.  I talked with the owners on a previous visit and they said all the right things.  I had them do some fairly minor things before which I thought might be a little pricey but did not break the bank so when I had some brake work to do on my F-150, I went back to Stamps.  I should note that in my younger days I did work on cars quite a bit so I'm probably not as easy as some to snooker.\nStamps did a brake inspection on my truck and told me that I basically needed new everything including rotors, calipers, pads, wheel bearings, et al.  The tab was an astounding $1,500+.  I tried to see if anything was optional to save cost but they said none of the rotors could be turned within tolerance and I needed all new parts for the front brakes.  The cost seemed excessive so I decided to get a second opinion before proceeding.\nSo I went to the new Brakes-Plus shop near Stamps and had them look at my brakes.  They concluded that I needed one new rotor (3 of 4 could be saved), new front calipers and that the wheel bearings were fine.  THE COST WAS ONE-HALF that quoted by Stamps.  I noted that all the parts quoted by Stamps were also about 50% more than BP.  \nBased on my experience, the bottom line is that Stamps appears to be overpriced and quotes work/parts you may not need.

If your still curios, keep reading.\n\nBeen to this location on two separate occasions.  \n\nFirst time, soon after they opened.  We were seated in the bar area.  Drinks and chips came out quick and that was the best part of the night.  I had to flag down our waitress several times to get a refill.  Chips weren't refilled.  Although at the door leading to the patio were about 6 of the  \"kids\" that refill drinks and refill chips just standing around not doing a lick of work.  Our dinner took about 1/2 hour to come out, and it was just eghhhh....  i chalked this experience up to grand opening issues.\n\nWaited about 3 weeks before heading back.  This time around it was 9pm on a Saturday night.  Again we were seated in the bar area.  One of the appetizer plates on our table had a thick glob of dried cheese on it.  The hostess took it back and then brought me a \"clean\" plate.  As she approached i saw her scraping something off it.  She dropped it off and and i pushed it to the side and walked over to 3 empty table before i found plates w/ no dried on food on them.  They must have issues w/ their dishwasher albeit human or machine.  We sat there for 15 minutes, in that time, no one ever took our drink order or ever  brought chips or water.  As I looked around, again there were people standing around by the door leading to the patio doing NOTHING....just standing around chit chatting.  At this point i had enough.  As we walked out, i turned around and decided to speak to the manager.   When he finally came out, i told him that we had been there for 15 minutes and no one took our drink order, that he had a staff of people standing at the door doing absolutely nothing.  He kinda of just stared at me w/ a deer in the headlights look.  He never apologized, just stood there looking around.\n\nAs you read other posts about this location, you will read about the other service issue.

We decided on the Shrimp & Pork Siu Mai (Very good!) and the Crispy Ocean Noodle dish.  The waitress said the noodle dish was a very large dish, enough for two people.  She must have been talking about the size of the plate rather than the portion, because it was far from a 2-person plate of food.  It was delicious, but there were only three shrimp and they had the heads on.  Some people may like this, but we were grossed out by it.  The waitress was very apologetic about it and said that she should have mentioned that the shrimp came with the heads on.  However, it really should be mentioned on the menu.  Another thing not mentioned on the menu is that there are no free refills on tea.  I had a small glass of iced tea for $4 and since the menu didn't state \"no refills\", I asked for seconds assuming it would be free of charge.

They really cater to the needs of their customers - not like many of those apathetic attitudes that are usually associated with other Viet pho places.  I've tried many of their other dishes:  spring rolls, soft shell crab, chicken wings (fish sauce flavoured - only place I know that actually serves this dish anywhere - you would find this dish if you were to travel to Vietnam), vermicelli noodles, and of course their desserts.  Whatever you order, you need to save room for desserts because they are amazing!\n\nDon't let their location deter you from coming to Pho Real!  It may be located admist industrial strips, but there is nothing bland about this place!  \n\nMany have commented on the price - but you truly pay for what you get!", "user_id": "TvFjcTK4poYWx8XQMb6NmA", "review_id": "QI7EZxQd7OlwpxRDAvy3cA", "cool": 2, "business_id": "hTUtle9Btvw-K_0ne0og_A"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 2, "funny": 0, "date": "2017-06-16", "text": "Usually my experience at Teriyaki Madness is nothing short of great.  The food is always fresh & the staff is always friendly.  However, my most recent experience was not a positive one.  \n\nI called ahead to order a spicy veggie plate (no meat).  Sandra (the supervisor) told me that they can only make veggie dishes in bowls, not plates.  I explained that I simply wanted to sub veggies for meat in the size of a plate.  She put me on hold for a minute, and then told me she would do that for me and that my order would be ready for pick up in 10 minutes.\n\nWhen I arrived the food was ready and I was helped by a young male cashier, who was very polite.  He told me the price would be $10.38 for my veggie & rice plate.  This confused me because this is even more expensive than a Chicken Breast Plate...  When I asked him why the veggies were so much more expensive he said he was a new employee and directed me to Sandra.  She proceeded to tell me that there's no button on their POS system for a veggie plate and that was the reason it was so expensive.  This still didn't make sense to me because on my receipt she charged me $7.09 for a veggie bowl and then an additional \"open food charge\" of $2.49...  Sandra insisted there was nothing she could do to lessen the price because there's no \"button\" on their system and she walked away to help other customers.  $10.38 is a lot of money to pay for white rice, cabbage, & broccoli.  Especially when the chick breast is cheaper!\n\nHaving worked in the food and beverage industry for many years (I even worked at Teriyaki Madness in my younger years) I know that there are ways to add, change, or delete certain charge amounts for \"open food\" charges.   \n\nI rarely write negative reviews because I'm usually pretty understanding, but this situation was not handled professionally.  Sandra wasn't rude, but her lack of ability to work the POS system or find the right \"buttons\" does not reflect the competency of a supervisor.   Instead, it shows laziness & that guest satisfaction is not important.\n\nThis situation may sound small, but it's the small inconveniences like this that drive customers away.", "user_id": "51-Gd3B1jg3eUrFJEP44mA", "review_id": "SS7O9TtNH6FqPi_77dtnBQ", "cool": 0, "business_id": "CVnfj-UBgOSEvcdt4eWUeA"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 4, "funny": 0, "date": "2012-10-30", "text": "Stopped in for a quick breakfast while in town.

This is really part of my current series of Downtown Calgary Lounge/Pub reviews.  What I would say though is that it is pretty funny to now see Nathans (which used to be a kind of a old school 80's Irish Pub like lounge/restaurant), now with new ownership, rebranded as 'Nathan's Tikka House' (think strip mall Indian food with ubiquitous 'lunch buffet').  \n\nWhat I can absolutely tell you is that (at least with respect to the lounge side) some things never change.  First the good news... Nathans is about the only place I can think of that has Big Rock Brewery's 'McNally's Extra Ale' on tap - from one of Calgary's premier, truely world class, breweries, McNally's is one of their flagship labels that has always done well at exhibition but for whatever reason has never really caught on with consumers (who are much more likely to buy Traditional or Grasshopper Wheat Ale).  To me, McNally's is really worth the trip.... maybe the only reason...\n\nNow the bad news(ish).. if you're looking to hide out some place where no one will ever see you have a beer, Nathan's is definitely your place.  Many afternoons (even after work...) there will be no more than 2 or 3 people in Nathan's (and one of them will be the bartender!).  It has that tired 80's feel throughout (sorry David G., with all respect, \"great atmosphere/ambiance\"?? really?  if you're comparing it to a Royal Canadian Legion branch or 'pub night' at a retirement park maybe, but otherwise I just don't see how you get there) and you you can't help but feel... that at any moment... suddenly... without any warning... absolutely nothing will happen.  You're nearly always right.  \n\nIn fairness, service is always decent (but then, when it's just you, the server and the bartender, how couldn't it be??).\n\nIf you're looking for somewhere out of the way and quiet where you can go have a beer and not run into your boss (or anyone else), Nathan's is your place!  ...otherwise you'd probably want to go elsewhere.", "user_id": "aKBKq3t9z8H-SmjoU_SnDg", "review_id": "DDGMEeAHnIC3KH0RgzQ1fw", "cool": 0, "business_id": "baME_ZBO1DotVtJDOmvnIw"}, {"useful": 9, "stars": 1, "funny": 0, "date": "2017-01-18", "text": "It is just a highway robbery for unsuspected travelers.

Not too far from the strip. There were some problems like bathroom locks not working properly, lights are weird, fridge wasn't working so staff had to bring up ice, etc.. But I still won't come back.\n\nNight one: A couple of girls get money stolen out of their wallets after leaving to go out for the night. We thought this might have been a mishap or miscounting of money or whatever, but it was $40 per girl and that is a lot of money when each girl only brings about $100 cash total. \n\nNight two: We all leave at 9:30PM for the night and come back around 2:30AM. This time around we were going to head out again for the night to go to get food and some girls that left their wallets out got  $40 stolen out of them. This time it was obvious because it happened the night before, it was the same amount, and the girls needed money to go out and eat... plus wallets and items were not placed in the same place or zipped up correctly. \n\nI decided to stay back with two girl friends while the rest of the group went to go out and eat. My friends fell asleep, but I was awake eating my leftovers and just hanging out on the inside one of the bedrooms when I hear a knock on the door. The first time, I ignored it (I WAS NOT getting up unless someone called me on my cell phone). Later on in the night, I heard a knock again so I go up to see if anyone was there. There wasn't.. and it kind of freaked me out. (Benefit of the doubt, it could have been another room being knocked on and I was paranoid). \n\nTo be honest though, the next day I realized that anyone could have gone into the room without me or my friends noticing because the doors are SO EXTREMELY QUIET (this would be a plus if people didn't steal stuff from our rooms) or it sounds like it's coming from the rest of the hotel. Someone could have definitely come in, saw my friends sleeping through the bedroom door and left all without me knowing. \n\nInformed the staff the next day & they checked \"maintenance records\" to see if any of the workers came into the room... of course there's are no records. Also told us to fill out a survey and they would get back to the group... & they still haven't responded.

For the 10 days my mom was there, she had diarrhea and I was on the phone (I live out of state) daily with the head of nursing about this.  She said that several fecal tests were run, but I am not sure.  I was astounded to learn at discharge that my mom was on both a stool softener and a laxative for impacted bowels!  Seven times daily loose bowel movements is not an impaction.  In addition, she left there with the diarrhea and in her new assisted living home she was still having the bowel problem and was tested and found to have C-difficile, a contagious intestinal infection and finally has antibiotics for it and is feeling better.\nThe case manager at one point a few days before discharge told me that my mom (remember she does not have dementia) had moderate dementia and needed 24 hour care (she was living completely independently before her fall).  She retracted her statement 12 hours later.  I think she was thinking of another patient. Big mistake, in my book.

Two of us had a very thick (we're talking at least half an inch thick) fat cap on about half of our steak. And the knife provided just was not up to the task of cutting through this tough fat cap.

Everyone I encountered was rude, but these two people especially are the reason I will Never set foot back inside the Mirage again. Nancy, was hateful, snide, rude to me and my husband. We were just trying to cash in our M life points to get a comp. ticket for the dolphin show for our kids.

She then said my husband and I BOTH had to show our I'd, ( so this would leave the kids alone)- not gonna happen. So I asked \"you want us to leave the babies\"? And then her less than intelligent co- worker \"Joe\" looks to the guest he was serving in front of him, rolls his eyes, and ask them what kind of idiots would leave there kid? And started laughing very condescendingly ...I heard him, so I asked for his name and told him he should not call guest names, and especially to other guest. I asked for their manager, and guess what, every single manager in the hotel took lunch together at 10:30 in the morning!!! Can you believe that? Neither did I! I told Nancy this too and she just laughed. Seriously. She also acted like she could not see the code I wrote down to redeem my tickets, she did everything she could to be a complete bit$h, for lack of better words. I could go on and on at the things these two did, but the review would be a short novel. Needless to say, Mirage hotel should know, they lost us forever as customers because of those two clowns.

Going to see movies at the theatre way back at the turn of the millennium. The old HMV where one of my good friends from high school worked.\n\nThese days, it's just depressing to see what this mall is, which is a shame because it's absolutely beautiful.\n\nI came here for a ceremony in the centre court - the Legends Row induction, which honored residents of the city for their contributions to community life, etc. I had the chance to take a walk around the mall and see some of the work that's been done since I last visited years ago.\n\nIf there is a reason to come here, it's for the food court. Light-years better than what it used to be, they've replaced the gaudy brown-and-beige chairs with a lighter color scheme, added a massive elevator that comes up from the lower floor, added much more seating space and diversified the food options (it's less fried Chinese food and more healthy eating, despite the presence of longtime mainstays A&W and Bourbon St. Grill). I sat for a while and just looked around, marveling at the work that had been done and how expansive the place felt for the first time in years.\n\nI wish I could say the same thing about the rest of the mall. While the revamped centre court is beautiful and a great spot for community events (like the aforementioned induction ceremony), the outer arms are desolate. I came here on a Saturday afternoon around 1 p.m. - which should be peak shopping time, and found the corridors devoid of foot traffic. There's still construction going on, some stores were either closed or haven't been re-leased since going vacant, and there's a weird malaise about the whole place. Even the Sears (which is in the process of going bankrupt) was sparsely populated - no sales, a few people just walking around aimlessly and the staff looking lost.\n\nYes, I know. Square One stole the thunder, and perhaps rightfully so. That shouldn't stop EMTC from carving out its own identity, though. Instead of these patchwork upgrades, the owners would do well to hash out a marketing campaign with a strong branding message or bring in more high-end stores, because I don't know who this place would appeal to. The low visitor numbers on a Saturday afternoon were downright ABYSMAL, and the only action was in the centre court for the aforementioned ceremony, which was free. It seems this place is stuck in the 90s.\n\nI did have the opportunity to meet the mall's marketing head, and did hear from her that they hold a lot of events at the mall. That's good... but it's not enough. Were it not for a handful of anchor stores (Walmart, the detached Indigo, Hudson's Bay) and the few attractions, this place would have been dead in the water years ago.\n\nIt pains me to say that, because I love this place. I have so many fond memories of experiences, which makes me wonder if it's simply a general downward trend in retail interest or if there's some underlying problem that needs to be addressed here. Yeah, it was cool getting some photo ops with local celebrities, but that doesn't help the mall pay the bills at the end of the day.\n\nI would hope to see EMTC roar back and reclaim some of its lost glory, but I fear that's going to take a long, long time, if ever. Regardless, there are some interesting sights here.

Last night a group of us decided to venture to the Mississauga/Oakville border just off of Dundas near the 403 for some after dinner shisha, and boy was it ever worth the trip. Al-Omda is tucked away in an industrial plaza so you'll need to keep an eye open or you may miss it. \n\nI'll start by saying, top to bottom, this is far and away, the best Hookah Lounge around. In fact the experience overall was so good that I plan to lower all my previous hookah lounge reviews down a star now that I know how good it can be.\n\nTo start each of us ordered out own hookah pipe with unique flavours - I've never done this before as to me Hookah/shisha was always a shared thing amongst friends, but now that I've done it this way, I'll never share again.. EVER. One of the guys in our group went for a special shisha which came with Pineapple and Coconut as well as a ice chamber around the base to cool his smoke. I was instantly jealous of this and asked if there was anything that could be done to cool my smoke... absolutely. they quickly went to the back and swapped out my hose for one with a frozen head (that resembled some sort of missile) that instantly changed the quality of my shisha experience by 1000%.\n\nThe service for the shisha is unmatched, compared to anywhere I have been before. not only did numerous servers stop by to check on us, but both owner, manager and chef from the kitchen. They really take customer service to the next level! In fact this was the first and only time that when the smoke got too harsh that a lounge employee actually serviced my hookah by removing the bowl, blowing backwards into it to clear the impurities before lightly rapping the bowl to move the cooked and uncooked shisha around. The minute he put it back down it was like a brand new bowl. Incredible.\n\nHaving already eaten I only briefly looked over their menu and noticed that their selection of (halal friendly) sandwiches which ranged from a Chicken Zinger to a Philly cheesesteak ranged in price from $5-10. While not ordering food I did have a mint tea which I learned was made from the authentic Lipton tea bags from Egypt (those who know the difference will understand what this means in terms of flavour and strength). The tea came in a massive mug and garnished with fresh mint leaves. It was fantastic with no chalky aftertaste.\n\nEventually we did get a little peckish and ended up ordering some sharable dessert items which were unbelievable! The first, and excuse my ignorance for not getting the name right, was phonetically called Konafa. This was sort of like a middle eastern dessert pizza made with cheese, pistachios and an assortment of sweet toppings that were, in short, a delight to put in my mouth!\n\nFollowing the dessert cheese pizza we got to try traditional warmed rice pudding, which was amazing as well. I really enjoyed the pistachios and cinnamon on top! Yum!!\n\nOne of the best things about this place was the prices. For the shisha and tea it was only $12 and change all in, I was shocked!\n\nThis place might be a tad hidden and out of the way for some, but those who can get here are lucky, this is an example of a true hidden gem in the 905. But don't tell too many of your friends because it's already super busy, my suggestion is to call ahead and book a table when you're thinking of heading over for a few games of dominos, PS4, board game and a shisha!", "user_id": "WeVkkF5L39888IPPlRhNpg", "review_id": "UF1ddALYZae8iP3nYwU2Kg", "cool": 6, "business_id": "j-_NkZGDBmnoDyv1NcZPkA"}, {"useful": 2, "stars": 2, "funny": 0, "date": "2015-10-12", "text": "I love the concept of the place and in theory, the food is amazing (the ingredients are fresh and the way they put together the bowls are delicious) but this place is a bit of a disaster.

The doors were square and boring.  They also had a wide (3\") stile between each cabinet door. The boxes themselves were in good shape.\n\nAbout a year ago we looked into refinishing the cabinets and received some bids. I was surprised by the high prices but it's a very labor intensive job so I suppose they made sense. In the end, we'd still have the oak and the boring look.\n\nFast forward one year and we started looking into re-facing. We received three bids that were all close to each other. We found Cabinet Cures at the Phoenix Home and Garden show and immediately liked Kelly (the owner), their process and the door samples. We scheduled an appointment for a bid. At first all we wanted done was the kitchen, a hutch, and a base bar cabinet. However, after looking at the prices and talking with Kelly we added the master bathroom, the main bathroom, a half bath and the laundry room. Yes, that's a lot of cabinets!\n\nWe couldn't be happier with the way this project went.  They came out twice to take and then confirm measurements and we waited about three weeks so the new doors, etc. could be made.\n\nAs Cabinet Cures will explain to you, they don't just apply thin veneer to your boxes and cabinet fronts.  They attach quarter-inch facings over everything.  Rather than the peel/stick glue used with the thin veneer they use wood glue with brads around the edges. No way moisture or heat will affect the bond in the future.\n\nThe crew showed up on the first day. Nice, friendly guys who laid paper down on the floors in front of the cabinets and the hallways. They also covered the counter tops with paper.  After that they went to work removing the old cabinet doors and drawer fronts.\nInstalling all of the quarter-inch panels and strips took days.  We found that another plus to using quarter-inch sheets was they were able to shim it out to cover an area that was a bit out of kilter.\n\nOn the last day the doors were installed.  Talk about a transformation! Our cabinets went from dated and boring to brand new and up-to-date. All of the new hinges are hidden and self closing.  They worked with us to place the knobs and pulls and the final result is, in a word, perfect.\n\nBecause of the number of cabinets (over 60 cabinet doors and 30 drawer fronts) it took five days to complete which is what we were told up front. There was no sense that they were in a hurry to get it done. In fact, just the opposite, I was impressed with the attention to detail.  Each day the crew swept the floors, put their tools and materials away and left the house they way they found it except for the paper on the floors and counter tops.\n\nAlthough Cabinet Cures is new to the Phoenix area they've been doing business in other cities for a number of years.

I've often used Hertz, but the prices at National seemed a lot more competitive so I decided to give them a shot.\n\nI'm not sure if National's Cleveland Airport is considered a big location, but this one seemed to be a small rental agency.  They did not have a huge selection of vehicles.  I utilized the executive aisle, which if you are a member in this program, allows you to pay for a premium mid-size vehicle but select any vehicle you like in the executive aisle.\n\nIt sounded like a nice service, but I think I probably did not have the best selection to pick from.  I think part of it was due to the size of the rental agency.  Also, I was coming in late on a Monday so probably a lot of the best cars were already taken.  They had a lot of minivans, which would not have been too bad if I had a big group.  There was also a Dodge Charger.\n\nThere were a few American sedans available, but many of them were older models and smelled of cigarette smoke even though I believe National has a smoke-free policy.

With the executive aisle, you just grab and go (the keys are inside; you show your ID at the exit station).  Returning is very similar to other rental agencies; you pull in the car and they do a quick check and signature.  This rental agency (along with the other ones like Hertz and Budget) is located in a facility not at the airport.  You have to take a shuttle to get to the airport (it takes 5-10 minutes).\n\nNational's online site for reserving cars was just okay.  The site just seemed to be a little amateurish in parts and did not have the sleekness of other travel transaction sites.  It was also occasionally difficult to use.\n\nAs mentioned, rental prices seemed reasonable when compared to Hertz.\n\nNational seems like a decent rental chain with good prices.  If you are eligible for the executive aisle, it is a neat little service though the selection of cars/SUVs may be limited depending on when you arrive.  I'm planning on using National executive aisle again and I hope their selection will be better the next go around.\n\nIf you need to park a car here, I'm not sure where you do it.  The car rental site is located a few miles away from Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.", "user_id": "w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ", "review_id": "VgM9zGFax45J4kNNPzVWXg", "cool": 9, "business_id": "Tf52sImSiJmMysBtXDVN7g"}, {"useful": 3, "stars": 1, "funny": 0, "date": "2016-11-05", "text": "These guys are crooks.

Sure.  The floors are polished concrete and the walls are glass and the roof is made from endangered snow leopard skulls (one of those things may be fake).  But it's not OVERWHELMINGLY loud.  It's just loud, with music and such, which is nice because there's nothing worse than going for happy hour somewhere and being able to hear yourself think.  If I wanted to listen to myself think, I wouldn't be out suffocating my brain with alcohol.\n\nIs the food amazing?  Hell, I don't know.  What do you even like?  Do you like simple stuff?  They do pretty solid bruschetta, We had like 3 different types and they were only $3 a piece on happy hour and of good size (real talk, Meridiem:  I love basil, but it doesn't really belong on the one with prosciutto.  Let the meat and cheese shine on that one.  Keep it on the caprese one though).  \n\nThere were some middle-aged dudes with rhinestone studded jeans there trying to impress the younger female bartender by ordering the most expensive thing on the menu, which was a steak and potatoes which I initially scoffed at like a wiener...but it actually looked really well cooked, I was impressed.  The guys took like 2 bites and then asked for a box because they had no intention of eating it, they just wanted an excuse to pull out their AMEX and hope someone was impressed (they weren't..it was a gold AMEX, come on dude.  No one gets excited for anything less than a black card, sheesh).\n\nAnd that leads me to the next question:  Is the clientele just a repeat of the upper-middle class faux-posh pseudo-cast of the Real Housewives of Chandler that tends to haunt everything in the Ocotillo area?  Sure, a little bit (so far).  There was a small smattering of the chalky-skinned burlap sacks of overly tanned makeup that take residence at The Living Room down the road, and the guys that look like they're hunting for those women.  But there's also a happy hour crowd, and random people that wandered over from the hotels, and the DJ helps bring the mood down about 10 years, so it's really not bad at all.  It's actually a solid spot for people watching and there are a lot of normal jeans and t-shirts type people there, and polo wearing folks that just got off of work down the road.  You're not out of place there no matter what.\n\nBut overall, the big questions is:  is it a good place to go?  And so far the answer is a resounding YES.  The prices are great considering how nice this place is inside.  $5 glasses of wine (a lot of them, even some local!) during happy hour.  Food at various price points, and they're not stingy (hopefully that doesn't change).  Decent music, great ambiance, some good drinks for cheap ($5 old fashioned poured so you actually taste whiskey before the ice melts).  \n\nCheck it out while you still can, because there isn't much else near there and this place is going to stay constantly filled up for a while.  \n\nBRB, gotta go order the steak with my Silver Wells Fargo card and see if anyone is impressed.", "user_id": "2es7AT3Q7tg1KGkUXXDTyg", "review_id": "EC-85B0KuyweBWszhSvGsA", "cool": 5, "business_id": "NPv4c-tDScToghoF9lnZbg"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 4, "funny": 0, "date": "2015-07-20", "text": "3-4 stars Pretty dead when I went which made it a little less fun, but I can't complain.

After an amazing wedding, there was no honeymoon period!  I went straight back to school and work full time!  It's still extremely important to me to tell everyone what an amazing job Jenny did on my dress and what a sweetheart she is to work with!  I cant say enough good things about Jenny!  I trusted her right away.  My wedding dress was the Vera Wang Ethel and was absolutely stunning.  I loved my dress from day 1, but I wanted a few tweaks done to it.  I wanted a sweetheart neckline with cups added so I could go without a bra underneath my dress, and also a rhinestone belt added to the waistline.  There were several other modifications that needed to be made as well that were very tedious and time consuming, but Jenny was up to the task.  She explained how she takes her time with each job because you cant rush this type of process.  She says she likes to stay true to the designer's work, so when making modifications to my Vera Wang she was very careful to do things perfectly.  As a bride, I know you can all appreciate that!!  \n\nMy dress was very form fitting and the zipper was very snug.   Towards the end of the process it was obvious that we were having trouble getting my zipper zipped; partly because of how tight the dress was fitting and partly because of the construction of the zipper/dress.  Jenny said no problem and worked her magic, which resulted in a more comfortable, perfectly fitting dress!  The dress was perfection and I got sooooo many compliments on it.  It looked good on me before, but after Jenny worked her magic it was out of this world gorgeous!   I cant thank Jenny enough! She's a true professional with a gift!

I am a senior citizen, living alone and quite frankly, I am afraid to use this unit because of the fact that the blower wasn't repaired, it was, as OneGuard stated, simply 'dirty'.

The whole \"surge\" thing was explained but is unethical to me, because the drivers end up explaining to a not happy rider all the rules.  All 3 times, I could not ID the Uber car....the sticker did not show, they were on the curb at the hotel and we were in the drop-off area. And giving us the license plate number means we would have to have the Uber PASS US to read it......that makes NO sense to me. The Make and model of car helped. From Ft. Worth to Dallas the driver was following Uber directions and the road was off left and the girls directions was \"stay in the right lane\" He knew where to take us and I used my app too.\nOur business will return to taxi cabs.

Definitely not as smooth and profoessional as I've had done elsewhere, but it was on the way home from work and close to my pad.\n\nI have a few issues with the staff/ownership here. The first issue is with one staff member in particular. I don't know his name, but I've never seen an employee have such an incredible outburst. I was actually afraid for my safety since I wasn't really sure what was going on.\n\nWhile getting a pedicure, I heard someone screaming hysterically \"YOU DON'T EVER TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, YOU FUCKING WHORE! TREAT ME LIKE A FUCKING SLAVE YOU FUCKING MANAGER WHORE... I'M NOT TAKING IT...I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!!!!\" \n\nThen there would be a brief silence and he'd start yelling and threatening again in a hysterical menacing tone. I thought a crazy homeless man had walked in the store with a gun. When I caught a glimpse of who it was, it dawned on me that they guy doing the yelling was a hairdresser who had left his client in the sink with a head full of shampoo. He was pacing back and forth hollering as though he was going to murder someone.\n\n\nUh... uncomfortable?\n\nAnd scary.\n\nAfter a bit more freaking out, he went to some room in the back where I'm assuming he cooled off. This took about 15 minutes. All the while, the poor girl was still sitting in the sink with lathered hair. None of the other employees offered her a towel, rinsed her hair-- nothing. From what I gleaned from the employees conversation, this wasn't the first time this guy had had a mental health day at work in front of a client. The staff were sick of him and quite frankly, I think they may have been having a giggle at his expense. Whatever the case, it was no cool to see such a bunch of employee bullshit out on the table for all to see.\n\nWhen it was time for my manicure at the front, I was glad to be away from this guy's station. I felt very uneasy and was honestly worried that he may go Columbine on everyone in the salon.\n\nWhen I went to pay, the owner seemed like a real scumbag. He had just showed up and was counting a big wad of cash. I tried to pay with the girls at the desk, but he insisted on helping me. When I go to a salon, I always try to tip cash. You never know where your money goes, and unless you give cash in hand, the owner could be stealing from his/her staff.

Much more convenient. And you get a receipt for it.\n\nMe: If I was going to tip, I'd like to give it directly to the person helping me.

This was one of our favorite dinner spots in New Orleans, and one we would frequent 3 to 4 times a month. Needless to say given our stellar experience at their New Orleans location we were expecting great service and excellent food, unfortunately neither of those were met. \n\nTo start, when we walked in both hostesses had their heads down looking at their screens, neither acknowledged our presence. After standing there for a minute the hostess on my right finally looked up, not saying a word just stared at me, at which point I said \"reservation for Ryan\" and all I got was \"last name\". I was then informed it would be a minute, no hello, no thank you, no please wait a moment, just \"it will be a few minutes\". Amazing. \n\nWe were seated in what seemed like the loudest room possible, directly in the center of the dining room, literally the opposite of the quiet table I asked for. Our server came to take our drink order (she was wonderful by the way, the only reason you even get a star, other than the fact I can't leave zero). The drinks were excellent, exactly as we remember (one of their signature cocktails we actually love is the coconut ginger lemon drop martini). \n\nWhile waiting for our food, which took an exceptionally long time, one of the waiters for another tables dropped and a tray of food directly on my chair. Thankfully none got on me or the cushion, although it startled the hell out of me and 500 degree plates could have burned quite a bit....\n\nThe food finally came, the steak was good, the sides were exceptionally smaller than we remember. We normally order one each and split them, there really wasn't enough to do that. When we would dine in New Orleans we would always have leftovers. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 had some leftover steak to take home, which was oddly placed in a bread bag, not the traditional to go bag.

Luckily, my husband was with me so I actually was able to climb with my toddler. I honestly could not believe what I saw. Kids were climbing all over each other, trampling the younger kids. There are holes that appear out of nowhere that drop down several feet. If a kid is in play mode and not watching their step I could see them seriously getting hurt. My toddler was terrified. We went up hoping to find a slide to come down but the structure is so dark you can hardly navigate through. \n\nAfter repeatedly asking kids to wait their turn while I had to literally carry my toddler down a steep ladder. We made it back down and found our way to the toddler area that is definitely not worth a $12 entry fee.\n\nThe cushioned blocks in the area are ripped and falling apart. There is a little climber that they have which she enjoyed for awhile until it became overcrowded. Also, most of the machines in the arcade were not functioning correctly and took our money without turning on.\n\nWe will not be returning. Our first visit definitely wasn't worth it.

We had heard great things and the reviews were mostly impressive so we were really excited to eat here. Sadly, it didn't live up to the hype today. I will say on a positive note, it has a really nice neighborhood casual atmosphere, their food is cooked in a healthier way than most restaurants, and they make their juices in house which are delicious! Highly recommend trying a juice if you go.\n\nUnfortunately, today, the food and service just didn't do it for us. We got the pad thai and the huevos rancheros. The pad thai had a nice tangy flavor and wasn't overloaded with oil, but overall wasn't very impressive and needed some more vegetables to jazz it up. The huevos rancheros had minimal flavor and had egg shells in it. Lastly, the service was fine but nothing to write home about. Our food took about 45 minutes and while she did update us once which was appreciated, we were hardly checked on after.\n\nLike I said, I wanted to love this place and I will absolutely be giving it a second chance (will update the review after), but today was just a two star performance.", "user_id": "CW1XEtbKm60ucBqdyylnkw", "review_id": "VJ9k7L30oBqaTeykEIXGXA", "cool": 2, "business_id": "EP1do6l8hLyIGEru0gN3EQ"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 4, "funny": 0, "date": "2016-06-14", "text": "Pretty expensive for juice and a salad. 18$ for my first visit.

I took some precautions and bought appropriate shoes for the event.  I arrived at the hotel on Monday morning and checked into a very nice room at Palms Place with a beautiful view of the mountains and a large tub with spa jets built-in.  My very first thought was this will be great for my feet each day after the show.\n\nWhen I arrived I found the tub in my room did not have any hot water.  After 7 calls over 3 days to Guest services they deemed they could not fix it and moved me to another room with tub that would not hold any water.  Their service is horrible and I never did get to take a bath in the hotel.  \n\nWe had several people with us at our trade show and the rooms had a few other problems but those problems pale in comparison with the tub/hotel service issue I had with the tub. Those type of problems included somewhat dirty rooms and other hot water issues.  \n\nHotels are a service industry and if you rank them based on the service they provide Palms Place failed miserably in my case.

Sunday, January 27th, 2013 was the day of the British Invasion, the day Gordon Ramsay would take Vegas by storm.  I decided this would be the ideal day to give BurGR another chance.  Let me tell you, the British must have come by sea, because two was the magic number.\n\nThe following is the review of BurGR that should have been penned the first time.\n\nCarved between separate halls of bustling casino exists a whimsically designed yet decidedly masculine cafe.  The eatery is home to the applewood grill and culinary delights of celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, a fact that cannot be forgotten due to the grand scale of pictorial homage.  Seated in the restaurant one cannot help but be reminded of a subtle cross between Hell's Kitchen and The F-Word.\n\nThe drink menu comes via Ramsay's staple iPad, there is a wide array of potables from the tabs of the tablet.  But since in Ramsay's restaurant, I decided to sample his favorite brew, Innis and Gunn a Scottish style ale aged in re-coopered barrels from alternating rum/whiskey sources.  The taste is sublime and soon our starter plate of hummus arrives to accompany the beer.  Ramsay's salt and pepper hummus is a little more garlic and salt than pepper but the bread is warm and fresh and the vegetable offerings conduct the hummus into a symphony for the palate.\n\nNext up, the Hell's Kitchen and Uber Cheese burgers arrive at the table.  The medium-rare temperature is a little more like medium but the patties have not lost their flavor.  The grilled jalapeno, avocado, and tomato team up on the Hell's Kitchen and complete their dinner service in style.  The Uber Cheese has three different types and styles of cheese together, from fontina to goat the cheese is undoubtedly the star of this burger.  Lost or overpowered are any subtlety in the cooking process, all that is left is a delicious sandwich fit for anyone braving the treacherous days and nights of Las Vegas.  The \"Just Fries\" are as billed, they come accompanied with Chipotle ketchup and Curry ketchup that are both made in house.  \n\nThe dessert menu is simple as is most of the menu really.  You can have your choice of flavor of pudding milkshake, or sticky toffee pudding push-pops which arrived at our table only moments after the burgers had been cleared.  The push-pop is a novel and flavorful package for sticky toffee pudding.  The salted peanut ice cream is devine and is a perfect mate for the sweet toffee pudding layers.\n\nThe most impressive piece of BurGR is not the decor, the location or even the food or drinks.  Ramsay has nailed the service experience at BurGR.  The servers are eager and knowledgeable.  They are impeccably dressed in GR labelled gear.  The hostess stand is state of the art with iPads and text message table notification.  The manager stopped by our table and was friendly and gracious.  This level of quality experience may be what sets this \"burger joint\" apart from all other \"burger joints\" in Vegas.\n\nWell Done", "user_id": "V6fWM24mP46KwJ5_zpEWNQ", "review_id": "-q8jeBuuFsgO_ssad8b6qw", "cool": 1, "business_id": "cYwJA2A6I12KNkm2rtXd5g"}, {"useful": 1, "stars": 4, "funny": 0, "date": "2016-08-15", "text": "I stayed here for 6 days in july.

Note: a party of two might not need a reservation but larger crowds will need one - we found the restaurant to be more of the gathering type.\n\nThe menu sounded audacious and mouthwatering but the actual dishes failed to deliver. We started with the horse carpaccio and the sea scallops, and we were impressed by the freshness, the balance of flavors and the creativity of the scallops. The combination of ingredients was interesting and each of the four scallops actually revealed four different flavors. The presentation paired perfectly with the elegance of the dishes with a very minimalist Japanese/Ikea approach.\n\nSadly, audacity and fresh ingredients are worth their (high) prices when top quality is reached and we were surprised at how much of a slapdash job LTPB made of its entrees. We had the halibut (wish I can't recommend enough) with chorizo ravioli and the fowl. While the fish really aced it with a very interesting use of the spicy side of the Spanish sausage, the poultry was almost half-cooked and lacked taste.\n\nMoreover, the staff has questionable wine tastes and recommended us with a bottle which was inadequate for our food. I would advise that you go by the glass to balance the appetizers and entrees which are too \"creative\" to ask for one specific wine.

Before I begin let me explain that I do not think my expectations would've been set as high if it wasn't for the prices. We've been to Soul Gastrolounge several times and always really enjoy it, and I just cannot on any level justify the fact that Tapas51 prices are right on par with Soul's prices but for much smaller portions.\n\nWhen we arrived the place was packed, but since we had reservations we were seated within a few minutes. Even as busy as they were, the staff was friendly and service as a whole was great.\n\nWe ordered the ceviche of the day, the taco of the day, grilled shrimp pupusa, Kobe beef kabob, and chorizo sliders.\n\nThe highlights of the meal were by far the pupusa and the chorizo sliders. I have eaten many pupusas in my day and I gotta say this is probably the best one I have ever had. It was moist, the cheese inside was nice and melted, and the grilled shrimp were cooked to perfection. I do think it was a bit overpriced at $9 since a pupusa is basically water and corn meal, but it was so good that I would happily pay that again. \n\nThe best dish of the night was the trio of chorizo sliders. The homemade chorizo patties inside one of the best biscuits I have ever had was just a perfect combination. The chorizo was moist and cooked perfectly and so was the biscuit and it I wasn't so full I would've definitely ordered another round!\n\nUnfortunately, the Kobe beef kabob was the biggest disappointment taste wise. It was overlooked and dry and I was a little sad that someone could do that to such a nice cut of meat. I am not a waster, but I took one bite and just couldn't justify eating the rest.\n\nThe taco of the day was a scallop taco on some sort of pistachio tortilla and the dish came with two tacos and each taco had 1 scallop cut in half. The taco was good, nothing really special, but I didn't think anything of it until we saw on your bill that it was $15.

The location is tucked away in a newer housing development called Inspirada. The space is nicely decorated and comfortable, with a local neighborhood vibe. So down to business. Let's talk about the coffee. I'm kind of a cappuccino nut because a good cappuccino requires the perfect balance of espresso and milk. One thing always worries me about coffee shops is when they have size options for cappuccino. Unfortunately, Jolly Beans has a small and large option which both consist of two espresso shots. I decided to try the small which is usually the safest bet. The cappuccino itself was very milk heavy which was a disappointment, although I will say it is far better than any other options in the area. It was much closer to a latte than a cappuccino. From a coffee standpoint, I feel like they are actually pretty close and will hopefully dial in the differences between a latte and a cappuccino. For most people, this may not matter much, but for discerning patrons it will be a problem. \nI have to say the owners are quite nice. They offered me a sample of one of their scones which was quite tasty. Rating this place is difficult. They are relatively new and their coffee is much better than any local chain in the area so for that reason I will be coming back. The space is comfortable and the owners are very welcoming and friendly. I only sampled the scone so I cannot comment on their other food options. For most people this place will be great. They have the standard tea, coffee, chai, and smoothie options which appeal to a wide audience. Rating primarily on the cappuccino, this is a 3-4 star coffee shop. I am rounding up to 4 stars because I am particularly picky when it comes to coffee and this place needs to be rated on more than just the coffee. For example, as a member of the local community, they have tools that you can borrow. That's super cool and friendly.

We were the first two parties seated when they opened the doors.\n\nYes, Samy was there working the front of the house and Amy was doing the cooking.  There was a crowd waiting but you had to be on \"the list\" to get in. It seemed like they sat 2 tables every few minutes so they didn't get slammed with 100 orders all at once.\n\nThere were reporters and gawkers all over outside but also Scottsdale police, security and the PR people guarding the door. They also had a professional video crew and photographers inside. We had to sign waivers to get in..\n\nWe were the first seated.  It was obvious that the staff was probably all brand new and understandably quite awkward with their first very customers. \n\nWe ordered the infamous \"truffle oil\" bacon burger and a pizza.  After ordering, just like on the show, the servers were grouped behind Samy, looking over his shoulder, waiting for him to enter their orders into the terminal.  \n\nThe food came out in a fairly reasonable amount of time and was actually quite good.  \n\nThe pizza was perfectly cooked and the nice thick burger was tasty and moist but not at all \"soggy\".  The burger was $14.50 and didn't include fries, but did have a small garnish salad on the side of the plate. It looked hand formed and was more than an inch thick.  The pizza was quite good and a pretty darn reasonable value. \n\nSamy came over a few times to ask how things were and when he saw us all typing into our phones and taking pictures of our food,  he just asked us only to think for ourselves, be fair, and tell the truth.   \n\nWe were there for just about 2 hours but that was mostly because they were slow getting started after being closed for days, had a brand new crew and were also managing the circus there. \n \nWe asked about Amy.  Samy said she personally cooks every single meal and could not step out of the kitchen.  We did spot her a few times and sure enough was speeding around working her butt off in the kitchen.   \n\nAs we were leaving, I began to think the drama on the show was actually real. \n \nSamy was nice enough,  but clearly the stress was building and that's not good for someone who doesn't seem to handle stress well.  \n\nAs the place began getting more full and the flow was going, there were 15 or so tables in play.  They were in various stages of being seated, ordering, eating, paying and waiting to be bussed, the wheels began to come off.  \n\nHe politely asked us how everything was but as I briefly responded he began to loudly clap his hands together, as you would at a bad dog,  and yell at a bus boy about not doing his job and his need to listen for the bell.  \n\nSo bottom line, the food was much better than it looked on TV but I saw enough to believe the volatile personalities, and subsequent trainwreck, were very real.\n\n\n\nI've received a few questions about the waiver:\n\nThere were a bunch of TV stations and newspaper reporters there but they were being chased away from the door by the security guards and actual Scottsdale police.\n\nInside was a photographer and a video crew taping everything.  \nThe waiver was a pretty standard \"You know we're taping this, we're not paying you and we can do whatever we want with the tape\" type deal.  \n\nI'm not sure what the taping was for, but they weren't intrusive.\n\n\n\n\n.", "user_id": "qzRHQKy7MVYO8-fWQU81dA", "review_id": "xcBvICTV_FGC6q0lZ6-J3w", "cool": 34, "business_id": "DN0b4Un8--Uf6SEWLeh0UA"}, {"useful": 7, "stars": 1, "funny": 1, "date": "2012-09-24", "text": "DO NOT BOOK THIS COMPANY ! \n\nFunny, my story is pretty similar to the other reviewer on here. \n\nHad a 28 passanger bus booked for my boss' bachelor party. The bus was supposed to pick us up at 8:00 PM, at 7:05 PM the dispatch person called me stating that the bus I was supposed to be getting had a bad fuel pump. But after an exhaustive search they found another bus (from another company) to replace mine. I booked the 28 passanger bus, because origianlly we had planned on being 24 people and didn't want to be sitting on top of each other. Thank god several people did not show, because the \"20\" passanger bus the sent couldn't accomodate 15 people. He said the replacement companies bus was $1200.00 for the night, but he was going to pay the extra $100.00 and reduce my rate by $100.00 for the problem. When the buss arrived, it looked like something that was used to transport troops out of a war zone. One of the windows was broken out and repaced by plywood, the air conditioning was weak at best and sounded like their was rocks rumbling around inside. It was dirty, glass was filthy and everytime the bus would stop at a light the lights would dim and the music would die. \nI asked the driver (who was the only redeeming thing on this night, a real nice guy) what company he was a driver for and he told me Luxor, and that this bus belonged to Luxor as well. The running joke of the evening was that nobody should get too drunk, we may have to push the bus at some point.

But it wasn't until I saw their menu online and found that they offer Filipino lumpia that just lit a fire under me and finally decided to go there for lunch. As soon as we sat down, without even looking at the menu, I asked our server to bring us lumpia for starters. Our server then brought us some bread with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and chopped olives for dipping. Nice touch! Browsing through the lunch menu while waiting for the food, decided to share the spaghetti squash with calamari and spicy marinara and the Korean barbecue ribs. \n\nOk, the lumpia arrived. There were 3 on a small plate with a couple of sauces. I think one was mustard-based and the other was apricot-based. I tend to be a purist and don't really like sauces. I tasted them, but went without for much of the lumpia appetizer. The good part? They were crispy, but that's about it. I could've sworn that when I saw the menu online, I saw pork lumpia. Traditionally, in Filipino cuisine, lumpia is filled with ground pork. The owner/Chef, Ricardo Sandoval is Filipino... so there was no reason for me to think that this lumpia would be filled with any other protein but pork. Disappointedly, I discovered in my first bite that the mushy filling in this lumpia was tofu. It prompted me to grab the menu again to verify (again, I didn't look at the menu when I asked for lumpia upon first sitting down). Sure enough, the menu says tofu. Definitely not grandma's lumpia and far away from tradition. Such a bummer! But I'm not mad at Ricardo... Fat Cats is known for the eclectic menu, not a traditional menu.\n\nOnto the  entrees. The spaghetti squash and calamari was delicious. My only criticism with it was that I thought the spaghetti squash was overdone and mushy. I'm used to spaghetti squash being more firm. The ribs... they were pretty good - it just wasn't what I expected, which was beef short ribs. The menu was a little vague with the description. When I hear Korean barbecue, I automatically think of kalbi - which I was really hoping for. The pork ribs that I got wasn't bad - nicely flavor and well-spiced. Aside from the spice, I failed to make the Korean connection.  Loved the tiny fries that came with it.\n\nDessert... got the bananas foster bread pudding with ice cream. It was great!!

When I pulled up, I was surprised to see that I had been here before. Apparently, Slate used to be another upscale restaurant I believe it was called Cafe Giorgio which was \"famous\" for their chicken whitford (?)  . Well, there are new owners now and, much to the disappointment of my dinning companions, they weren't willing to give the whitford a shot. However, the menu did have some interesting and equally alluring selections. I chose to go with the pork mignon.The menu stated that the pork was topped with flat iron apple and apricot/orange rosemary glaze. I didn't really taste much of the apple and feel that it might have been better served in a chutney form. Also to note, in addition to the no substitutions rule, they have a very limited selection for sides. A starch du jour and a veggie du jour. You can get 1 starch and 1 veggie or two of either. I chose one of each which happened to be Yukon gold mashed pots and a carrot, broc, cauli mix. The sides were really basic for me. Nothing special about them. This is what I would expect from a run of the mill diner, not a nice 20-30$ a plate restaurant. Maybe that is part of the reason why the dining room was only about 25% full on a Friday night. For dessert, I decided to try the warm chocolate brownie with homemade strawberry ice cream. Again, I was left disappointed. The ice cream had huge chunks of frozen, inedible strawberries and the brownie was so light and fluffy that the ice cream chunks over powered any chocolatey taste. I was left craving a thick gooey, hearty brownie. What they served was not fit to share the brownie name. \nIn addition, the service was odd to say the least. Our waitress didn't seem to know the answer to our basic questions and had a difficult time separating the checks by couple. It seemed like maybe it was her first day. All in all, I don't think I will be going back to Slate Bistro barring some significant changes. My food/experience was not bad per say, but I do expect a higher quality for the price range.

David was absolutely incredible!! Super friendly and funny from the beginning. He was professional and knew the menu very well, but also made you feel comfortable.

This is a smaller restaurant with a very \"homey feel\".  No frills but a really cool Italian/\"Mom's kinda place\" atmosphere and they have great service.  \n\nThere were so many things we wanted to try, one of which was pizza cooked in their wood-fueled-brick-oven.  We tried the La Pizza Bianco ~ it has a mildly chewy somewhat thin crust, blistered and charred in spots.  It was a bit chewier than what I expected so we had to eat it with a fork, but still very tasty.  It had fresh mozzarella, ricotta, lots of basil and garlic, and their garlic butter sauce. This pie was delicious and it could possibly be good at repelling vampires but not a good choice for a first date with someone you're going to kiss afterwards... \n\nThey have a wide variety of pastas and salads to choose from as well.  On our second visit we tried their linguine with red clam sauce which was also very good.  The clams were cooked well, tender not over done like at most places and their marinara sauce was on point! We also order just a slice of pizza and side salad.  This was somewhat disappointing because the slice of pizza tasted somewhat old and of course reheated.  It did not have the same \"wow\" tasting factor as did our pizza on our prior visit.  We shared this with our server and she stated it was how they serve their slices and did not offer a new slice...  \n\nWe ordered some New York Cheese Cake for desert and it was delish as well! Another person had a slice of pizza \n\nThis is a great place to go if you're looking for good Italian food and fantastic pizza! Our only concern was ordering just a slice that was old and reheating it is usually fine but not in this case, this slice was too old.

The pub was not packed on a Saturday night and there were about three other booths available and many free seating at the front. After being seated and our drinks ordered, we waited for about 10-15 minutes before the waitress came around again and asked us if we wanted a food menu. Typically, that should be the first thing to ask your patrons. Once the food arrived, we were not satisfied with the food but we already expected it to be below average but we were happy to have a drink and watch the basketball game. A while later a group of four people came around our area and decided to sit on the high tables across from us. We assumed that they wanted to watch the basketball game as well since we were seated at the very back while there were many free seating with multiple TVs playing the UFC fight. After a few minutes, our waitress came around and changed the channel without mentioning to us that she would or even acknowledging the fact that we were watching the basketball game. I would understand it if it was another waitress that changed the channel but we specifically asked our waitress when we walked into the pub that we wanted to watch the basketball game and that our dedicated TV at our booth was too dim and wanted the screen to be brighter. She had full knowledge that we were there to watch the basketball game and that we wanted to be seated where we could watch the game. \n\nGenerally, we would let it pass and not make a big deal about it but the lack of acknowledgement and attempt to try and accommodate both groups of customers and make everyone happy was unacceptable. Our waitress did not attempt to tell the other group or even make the suggestion to ask them if they wanted to be seated elsewhere where multiple TVs were playing the UFC fight. When we confronted the waitress, she said the owner wanted to only show the UFC fight since it is an important fight which we would understand but there was another TV playing the basketball game at the front. We pointed it out to her and she said it's because the customer wanted to watch it... Here's a thought, are we not paying customers?  It is safe to say that WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS PUB no matter how close and convenient it is for us. Two Headed Dog just lost two customers who were able to overlook the bad food. It's time to train your staff on some customer services best practices. \n\nSave your time people and head elsewhere.", "user_id": "CzgZt_C31sorjhGF4Wvqeg", "review_id": "3_a4r875LIPrfF1DHLiBag", "cool": 1, "business_id": "3iOwOfLC3LPcM6Q6OUQuzA"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 1, "funny": 1, "date": "2017-12-21", "text": "Can the owners of the mall please shut his ghetto ass place you call a family restaurant down it's not doing anything but causing a bad experience at the food court in Northlake mall.

Signage for the restaurant is subtle so you may have to look up from your phone to find it :) \n\nThe restaurant has a very open, trendy, cozy atmosphere. The floor-to-ceiling glass walls create a very exposed and airy ambiance. The kitchen is also enclosed in a similar set up; it's enclosed, yet open. They have indoor and outdoor seating in both a traditional dining and a lounge setting. Noise level is on the quieter end, and I think it amazing, especially after a long day at work. The back-patio seating faces the pool with Camelback Mountain in the backdrop. It's quite a view. \n\nService was good. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. We were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress, Molly, was very quick and helpful. The food came out relatively quickly but also the restaurant was mostly empty. We came here for dinner on a weekday and had a reservation, but I do not think you'll need a reservation if you visit it on a weekday evening. \n\nThe menu items are intended to be shared amongst the table so the appetizers are served tapas style and all the entree items, which are called \"for the table,\" were cut into sharable pieces. For appetizers, we ordered the dates and goat cheese dumplings. For dinner, we shared the NY strip steak with a side of shishito peppers. I have to commend them for the great job they've done creating a menu full of distinct items, their use of ingredients, and their presentation of the food. However, all of the dishes we ordered were too sweet. I felt the dates were more appropriate for dessert, and the ny strip steak had a sweet glaze on it and was surrounded by a black garlic glaze, also sweet. The goat cheese dumplings lacked flavor and the accompanying marinated spaghetti squash was again, sweet. Maybe it was the dishes we chose, but I would have liked to see more diverse flavors from one plate to the next.\n\nThe facility is very clean and well maintained.

I later called and complained, but the manager said that I was overreacting, and no disciplinary action was taken. Nice. \n\nMy recent experience: I took my kids here to get a couple Coolattas, and it took over 20 minutes for them to make 2 drinks. One customer was so angry, that he yelled at my 9 year old son for \"grabbing his drink\" (we were already waiting for 15 minutes, and my 9 year old thought it was his drink - which was logical considering the guy came in about 10 minutes after we already ordered our drinks). I understand that this customer's rage was not DD's fault, but the overall vibe of the place drives people to madness.\n\nIn short: There are many other options in the area that provide great food and service.

There were two long sharable tables up top and a section of separate tables along the back.\n\nThe waitress was patient with us, even with all the other people placing their orders, or trying to make their way in. I ordered the Chai Nom Yen to drink - An infusion of Thai spices and black tea mixed with condensed milk.. aka thai iced tea. The black tea had definitely been steeped for a long time because it was a very dark colour, close to an orange. Being the thanksgiving season, you would've thought you were drinking a pumpkin shake. the drink was rich, tasted like a strong bubble tea and although mighty tasty, it was a huge cup. The condensed milk was definitely sweet, but I would suggest sharing, unless it is a super hot day and you take it to go - got to save room for the food!\n\nWe shared an appie of garlic shrimp, which was butterflied, pankoed and fried. Very tasty. For mains - the ever famous Sam Roas Pad Thai - i could taste the three flavours with every bite - it never went away and my tastebuds never got accustomed to one specific taste - it was fascinating! I had expected the sauce to be more wet as the textures were more dry, but I have nothing against it. This must be what everyone spoke about with its authenticity.\n\nThe Khao Soi with beef brisket was superb! I'm all about sauce and it is a rich, flavourful, curry that I wanted all to myself. The noodles were a great texture, the beef was so tender, and I wish there was a bigger bowl!\n\nWe got a curry - Gaeng Massaman with chicken, which consisted of tamarind sauce and cooked with onions, peanuts, potatoes and bay leaves; topped with crispy deep fried shallots. Yes the chicken was tender, but I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary..\n\nLittle did I know the reason we were sitting at the communal high tops is because the restaurant was not able to give us our table for our 8 oclock reservation. Because of this, we were given free dessert!!!! It was a little bowl of warm coconut sago - which I love. The only thing I would have preferred was that it was either super hot or super cold.. and it was in between.\n\nDespite how crowded it was and the loudness of the place, the service was really good. the transition between appie to main course took a REALLY long time, so I can only hope that it doesn't always take that long.

Although I am NOT a smoker, I know this. Also, bars in other locales once featured lots and lots of smoking. Things in these places have changed. Things in Vegas, at least as of February 2015, havent, so writing that \"It's smokey in here!\" or \"OHMYGOD, it smells like a dirty ashtray!\" are statements likely unneeded by folks who want to visit (expletive deleted) Tiki bars for throwback atmosphere and drinks. Now onto what you came for:\n\nNon-descript, but wholly mid-century, exterior, as well as standing and neon signage only hints at how much love and preparation were expended by the fine folks of Frankie's Tiki Room. It's a blast from a post-WWII past, filled with just the right combination of kitsch, darkness, on-point cocktails (both the classics and some new homages to the South Pacific), dapper design and yes, SMOKE. An extremely well-written menu will guide newbies in their drink selections - liking rum, coconut and/or more exotic fruit juices will likely make your choice(s) easier or more difficult - as will the bartender on duty. The place is very much a drinking bar, with only one bartender and the need to call and pick-up drinks at the rail, so have no expectation of table service. A lone TV plays a wonderful selection of B-movie clips, smokers, musical performances from shows like HOOTENANNY and SHINDIG and old surf footage on a continous, silent loop. Our visit on an early Sunday night revealed mostly locals of all ages in various configurations (singles, couples, groups) and the vibe was very laid back. I was with a friend who's a local who said that a chunk of the business is health care workers from the hospital roughly a block away and I found that easy to believe. Drinks from the menu are $9 ($25 in a souvenier Tiki mug) and I believe non-tropical well drinks are $5. As nearly everyone has mentioned, these drinks are tasty, silent and potentially deadly. I'm a former bartender and I had to nurse both of mine AND dilute them with ice, so maybe a designated driver might be in order. If you like unusual places, adore vintage living and/or interiors or simply want a great drink at a very reasonable price in an atmosphere no longer seen, Frankie's Tiki Room is a solid choice for an evening of imbibing.", "user_id": "lZr8K_ClAnSCFWdOfXKZnw", "review_id": "-6H9bG35VwezyJ5klESgDQ", "cool": 7, "business_id": "fQt9QVAZM9PM0wFDdROvWw"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "date": "2016-09-29", "text": "The sweetest puppy and ladies made me feel so welcome, and the selection was fantastic in all sizes.

The first time, we were laughed out of the joint because of our disbelief of a two hour table turn at 9pm on a Saturday night. Allow me to save you money and 2-3 hours of your life, DO NOT EAT HERE. Reasons are listed below. \n\nThe margaritas are terrible. Really?  You want to charge me $8-$9 for a margarita from a plastic jug with close to bottom tier tequila?  I consider myself a margarita connoisseur. Charging anyone said amount of money for something that isn't made to order is a crime and an embarrassment. I couldn't taste anything that resembled an alcoholic drink due to all of the sugar. Thanks in advance for the hangover and stomachache tomorrow. The owner should be ashamed. \n\nPoint two - you tell me there is a two hour wait for a table and then magically 3 open tables appear in twenty minutes. Joke.... Sounds like you are trying to make this place sound more in demand than it should be. \n\nJust to break up the negative - the goat cheese guacamole was pretty good. Chips, not so much. \n\nTamale - this make me rage in anger typing this. After having this hyped up by the waiter, we got this as one of our entrees. Mistake number 25. We could have made this at home. The tamale portion of the meal was atrocious. Just because you throw a can of corn in the masa does not mean the tamale will come out moist and delicious. The tamale was crumbly and dry. The short rib on top had some good flavors. Too bad my wife and I both had to spit out chucks of fat into our napkins. Poor poor poor dish. If you are going to charge me $17 for something that cost $6 for you to make, it better be executed perfectly. \n\nSteak tacos - the steak was cooked well. I love hanger steak but I was not blown away. However this portion of the dinner was decent. Except for you serving me Mission brand tortillas that were heated in a microwave. At least throw them on a flat top if you aren't going to make them yourselves. Which you should be doing considering the prices on the menu. \n \nIn general the sauces and salsas were all pretty good!\n\nRather than ordering another terrible margarita I opted for a Pacifico to close my meal. In all honesty, I've had better margaritas at a state fair. I thought about ordering a flight of margaritas, but then I saw all 8 of those come from plastic gallon jugs as well. \n\nOur waiter was decent until we got to the end of the meal. He threw us a sales pitch for us to visit, what I assume is their sister restaurant, SOHO for brunch. Pass. My wife then made a comment about a drink at a Michael Symon restaurant to which the waiter rebutted that Cleveland restaurants all do the \"Michael Symon\" thing, but he just gets all the credit.\n\nWhatever. Won't be back. Maybe next time I'll hit up a Michael Symon joint rather than be a patron of a place trying to profit off the \"hipness\" of Ohio City, Cleveland.", "user_id": "dGop5L0sI_KhHlm-iUnARQ", "review_id": "W45RvyndBKHqeV1CpA_GUA", "cool": 2, "business_id": "F2pfjAZ_3dMTGCKv6c5wOw"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "date": "2015-10-28", "text": "This place was a hidden gem.

Yikes! \n\nSince I was only looking for a trim, I was just interested in a cheap cut. My friend gave me a coupon for $5 off the regular adult $15 cut. This $10 haircut has made my hair look better than ever.\n\nI have naturally curly hair, but I straighten daily so my stylist Abby gave me a dry cut. It was my first dry cut, but now I think I will always insist on it. We were able to see exactly how much length I was losing (or more importantly keeping!) and gave a good feel when she thinned my hair out. My hair looks like it barely lost any length, only so much healthier and maintained. I swear it even looks shinier! It was Abby's day off but she took me as a client because the salon got slammed suddenly while she she was there getting her own hair done. I'm so grateful she did!\n\nAbby is definitely 5 stars. The salon is just average. The receptionist is pretty much a dingbat, she seemed quite flustered when my sister and I came as a walk-in and we were told to come back in 45 minutes even though there was only one person in a chair and no one in the waiting area.

My experience here was exactly as I had hoped it would be and the food was better than most of the Asian restaurants around this area. You can't complain that the food is boring if you're ordering vegetable lo mein. Branch out and try something that you wouldn't normally get from your local \"Dragon House\" or \"Mr Chow's.\" It's an upscale restaurant, so everything from the rice to the napkins will be expensive. It'll be that way wherever you go. DUH..\n\n*The website is epic.*\n\nI especially liked the interiors of Enso. A lot of thought was put into evoking a contemporary fine dining atmosphere with a bit of Asian flair. It was a little too dark for my taste (difficult to take pics), but that didn't deter from the quality of my visit. We started off with the chicken lettuce wraps and the Asian ceviche. The wraps were exquisite. The peanut sauce was far better than the chicken sauttee peanut sauce I was expecting. It was slightly tangy, salty, and the peanut flavor was milder, allowing the minced chicken to stand out. The Asian ceviche was good, but the cucumber was somewat overpowering the fish. Needed more citrus and seasoning, but I let it slide because it was fresh and a good contrast to the rest of the meal. \n\nThe next course was the greatest Korean Short Rib (Kalbi) I've had in a while. Think of freshly pulled pork, but in beef form, with a ton of spices, gooey marinade, and melt-in-your-mouth streaks of fat. All this laid neatly upon the actual short rib bone that rests upon some type of rice preparation and sweet sauce. It was so delicious. My mouth is watering thinking of it. The other entree was the pan seared scallops with the cone/turd looking like edamame mashed potatoes. It could be a little too salty for some people's taste, but I loved it. Powerful and in-your-face flavors. \n\nWe also sampled the sushi, which was indeed expensive, but spoke for itself with its sheer quality. I ordered the Toro Crunch or something like that and the dish wasn't overpowered by marinades or sauces and was finished with a piece of tuna sashimi on top. Perfect chewiness to the rice. I didn't even reach for the soy.\n\nThe waitress was knowledgeable of the menu and had superb recommendations. The place wasn't busy which is why we probably got our food promptly. I've been back three times now. It's that good\n\nI highly recommend it.

What threw us off about this one is that the staff member at the beginning of the room told us that anything we found in each room wouldn't be needed for the next room. This isn't true since you have to go back to the first room to solve the rubiks cube. This is also the only puzzle that makes you do that, that takes you out of a sequential order.

The size of fish on the nigiri is on the smaller side, but the amount of rice is proportionally less too so that's nice.

I was looking for something dark, but not too dark. I also wanted a shade that transitions really good from back to front.  Eco-Tint knew exactly what I was looking for. They suggested 35% for the driver/passenger side and 15% for the back. A tint job usually takes about 3 hours. Mine took about 2 hours. That's what I call \"service with the quickness\". The job was clean and with no bubbles. After the work was done, Eco-Tint explained what to expect for the next few days, detailed the lifetime warranty, and welcomed me back for next time.

There are also two rock climbing walls and arcade type games.\n\nCons: \n~Bathrooms were gross. Water all over the counters, garbage on the floor, etc. I opened one stall door and apparently the toilet had a leak. I deduced this in part to 1) my fine detective skills and 2) a large clear plastic bag that was over the entire back of the toilet and went into a garbage can filled to the brim with dirty toilet water next to it. Why not just put an \"out of order\" sign up?\n~Food and drink prices. Obvious, I know. A medium fountain drink is $4,75, which is just ridiculous. Also, apparently, it is now harder to sneak foodstuff in. There is a sign up at the front door prohibiting bringing in any food or drink and the establishment reserves the right to check your bags.

Our lovely waitress mentioned they're fairly new to the brunch scene so I was just going to roll with it. When I walked in, I kind of imagined it differently in my head and the name of the place didn't match up to what it looked like or what kind of food they served. Of course we all have different imaginations so what I thought it was going to be didn't mean it wasn't great on its own.\n\nThe decor was really cool, dim, and trendy. It was a more compact place with a small bar up front with a few booths on the right and two long high tables on the left. Towards the back there was some seating and they also had what looked like secret pathways to the sides and downstairs to the back. I felt like I was going on an adventure when I wanted to find the bathroom. Four of us sat at one of the long, high tables, which I found to be a good height with great lighting. Our waitress approached us quickly and explained the menu/poured water.\n\nI wasn't going to get an adult beverage, but I saw the cereal milk punch that has bourbon, brandy, brown sugar, cinnamon toast crunch milk, blackstrap cream, and nutmeg. I don't even eat cereal and I thought this was such a cool idea. I had to have it! I was really pleased with the serving and the overall taste of it. It came in a smaller glass and smelled like apple pie. When I tasted it, it wasn't overpowering and it did remind me of cinnamon toast crunch. Yum! One of my favorite things was their bread platter. A nice young man walked over with four different kinds of goodies with homemade butter and jam. We could pick four for $3. I decided on one of each and I am so glad I did. The pumpkin bread, the chive something or other biscuit, and the other two items were amazing. I added butter and jam with delight.\n\nFor the main dish I got the stuffed crepe with braised goat, roasted potatoes, pepper relish, scrambled eggs, and a simple salad that came with it. Man, what a combination of flavors! Even though the salad was simple, it still had great flavor. The crepe with goat was my favorite. Incredibly satisfying with all kinds of tastebud approved experiences in there. I'm happy we came here.

Later I noticed these small pizza plates stuck to the side wall adjacent to the menu which listed some of the pizza options still available not on the new menu, but it was nearly impossible to read the ingredients list for those options. \n\nOn the other hand, the place was kind of like the Subway of pizza. You choose your bread--regular or whole wheat--and size, then you either get one of the pre-decided combinations or you choose your own toppings. Everything was fresh and you could taste that difference. Plus, if you sign up for their rewards program, you get a free 9\" pizza just for signing up and it's essentially a buy 10 get one free system. \n\nI am really looking forward to coming back and trying their foldwiches which are--you guessed it--taco-like sandwiches made by folding a pizza dough in half (think calzone that doesn't get rolled closed) as well as their breakfast options (although those look a little small). \n\nReasons for not four stars: menu/ordering issues as stated above, slowness of cooking time (there is an order online option which I might try in the future), lack of seating and tables which have residual oil on them (I'm in my work clothes for goodness sake!), and the fact that it cost $0.50 for an extra topping on a 9\" pizza when there's more than one inch of topping-less crust (so ~7\" of topping space).

I reviewed the menu above the counter and then sat down to review a physical menu because I planned on dining in. After waiting/realizing that NO ONE was going to take my order, I had to walk up myself to the counter to place my order. While waiting for my food no one attended to me and while eating it was the same .... I ordered the half chicken combo with black beans and white rice. The chicken tasted okay, the white rice tasted old and stale, and the black beans tasted very bland. When I was done no one placed the bill on my table, so I had to walk to the counter to receive and pay for the bill--yet this is supposed to be a sit down establishment. I told the manager, Will, about the crappy customer service and he seemed nonchalant about the matter.

Contrary to another review, I did not find the mashed potatoes to have too much butter. In comparison, it could be due to your palate; if you enjoy American mashed potatoes (e.g., with butter and milk), you will enjoy this side. The ribs are enough to fill one very hungry person, or satiate two people.\n\nThe important take-away from this review is that I did not come into the restaurant with expectations, hence the 4 stars.

I was skeptical, but I had a dream.\n\nI decided to come back the next morning before the advertised opening hour of the entire mall. I sneaked in through a side door, and ran to Shoe Palace. Oddly enough, there was nobody outside of the store. I asked the employees through a half-open store gate if they were ready for the drop, and they said that the employee lied to me! They didn't have the shoes! I don't know if they got backdoored, the employee from that morning was lying, or the one from the day before was misinformed, but I was just so done at this point.

I was unsure to allow him because he has difficulties following the class, when everyone goes to the right he goes to the left, but the woman did not mind. \nMy son was really happy because he can follow the teacher, then the teacher saw him, she walked towards my 12 years old and started to physical pushing him and grab his arm and pulling him to the back of the class. \nI won't recommend this place because they hire trainers or instructors who physical abuse minors because they had difficulties following the class.\nAfter I spoke to the manager, in my way out to my car, the Yoga instructor apologized to me and said I misunderstood what she told me and ask us to go back to her class.\nMy son was crying and asking me why the don't accept him, he said I didn't not do anything wrong I was just trying to follow the class.\nI feel horrible because my son was physical and emotional abuse, my other two kids love this place, and I don't know what to do.", "user_id": "kFlNG0n7f0nkl1jYLD_RRA", "review_id": "gMJiPlbu0GBV5gnKJChCHw", "cool": 0, "business_id": "yj8lfLr9fn9g_0nqHluLRQ"}, {"useful": 1, "stars": 2, "funny": 0, "date": "2017-04-13", "text": "Tried this place out tonight for carryout.

We had a 5:30 reso on a Wednesday afternoon; the place had a line around the door but separated into those with reservations and walk ins. We were seated immediately when they opened and every single staff member was friendly and welcoming. The new location is sophisticated yet comfortable, with an authentic ambiance that doesn't come across as kitschy. We were offered recommendations and given an opportunity to ask questions before ordering, and didn't feel at all rushed. We went with the \"egg roll\" appetizer to start-although these rolls are usually considered spring rolls at the Thai restaurants were used to (Detroit area). They had thin, freshly wrapped rice paper fried to golden brown perfection and full of mildly seasoned veggies and cabbage. The sweet and sour sauce was a great compliment to the savory and crunchy roll. One of the best spring rolls I've had! It was also vegetarian. Next we each tried a Tom Yum (hot and sour) soup, mine with shrimp and my fianc\u00e9's with chicken. He got a level 7 spice and I went with a 5. (Level 1-10 with 3 being a Tabasco sauce for comparison). They were generously spiced while still maintaining a depth of flavor from the lime juice, coconut milk, and meat broth. The shrimp and chicken in the soup was plentiful and not dried out whatsoever even after sitting out while we finished our rolls. It was rich but refreshing, the perfect soup. For entrees we split two dishes. First the signature Garlic Prawns, which are large fresh caught prawns flash fried in a light seasoned batter including the tail (which is delectable and edible like a crunchy snack) and coated in a herby garlic sauce with sesame seeds. It was simply amazing. The crunch was on point and flavor was clean but decadent; the shrimp were cooked just long enough. We also split a chicken pad Thai, which had just the right spice level and umami flavor to be a top 5 pad Thai, but the noodles were the star. They clearly have perfected the soaking and cooking of their rice noodles. They were velvety soft without becoming mushy and held onto the sauce. All over an amazing Thai food experience. We also ended up needing to leave early to head back to the strip and meet friends and took our entrees to go halfway through. The dishes held their integrity and were just as flavorful later on!

The meal began great with no wait and a very friendly and encouraging hostess who sat us promptly and explained the concept. We ordered the crawfish, clams, shrimp and snow crab. Each arrived at different times in plastic bags but within 20 minutes from ordering. I am a chef, so maybe I see things that others don't. The shrimp were served head on which should be reserved. for only fresh caught as the brains spoil within a day and these had been spoiled a few days ago. The heavy spiced sauce covered the taste. The clams were good and tasty but 8 shells per pound had no clam inside which was a letdown. I scoured the bottom of the bag hoping to find the missing clams to no avail, they must be in the boil pot which made me disappointed to psy for just shells. The snow crab was mushy and does not pare well with the over spiced sauces, my ordering fault. Our server was friendly but we never saw her again after taking iur order but maybe they share tables as we were serviced by 3 others. All in all a unique idea but lacking in quality fot the price paid. I almost want to try again as I love crab and shrimp boils but to spend $60 for 2 to walk away hungry and question the quality is too much for me.

I walked away really hoping that we could safely fly without reaction. To my surprise, a gentleman approached my family and asked who was the child allergic to nuts... My daughter spoke up and owned it. He asked what he could do to make it a safer flight. I was in complete shock he cared for one and then I realized it was the PILOT! Captain RICK assured me he would do what he could in his power to keep her safe and that he would not hesitate to land the plane, upon an emergency. Captain Rick, your compassion for my child and all those people with life threatening food allergies--- DID NOT go unnoticed. We will never forget your efforts and kind heart.

Spirit is the Motel 6 of the skies.\n\nI traveled to and from Minneapolis and Vegas this week and had some interesting experiences.  I'm a chill, go-with-the-flow kind of person and since I made it back and forth and lived to tell the tale, I'm pretty good with the whole situation.\n\nNo doubt - the flights are packed.  It's kind of like being in steerage on the Titanic.  They squeeze as many of you as they can into a tiny space, and avoid any frills so that they don't have to charge an arm and a leg.  And for a 3-hour flight it was tolerable.  \n\nI took the red-eye out and there wasn't much sleep to be had.  It's not the most comfortable of seating.  That - and one of the flight attendants sat in the back and griped to the other flight attendants the entire trip.  And she had one of those voices that was kind of shrill and annoying.  Think Valley girl meets Janice from Friends (only, no laugh - thank goodness).  I was pretty sick of her dramatic tales of gossip at 3 am by the time we landed at 6:30 am,  but we got there ahead of schedule and we lived!  \n\nThe flight home was a little more interesting.  It was scheduled to leave at 9:50 pm, but I began receiving emails several hours before alerting me to a delay.  That was nice - I got to spend a little more time in the Mall of America before turning in the rental car and heading back to Charles Lindbergh.  Anyway...once at the gate we started to get reports of mechanical failure of our plane in Houston (that's the same story all of my co-workers said they were told when they have flown on Spirit and were delayed in the past) and a new plane coming from Chicago to \"save the day\" we sat in the airport until after midnight before finally being able to board.  By now the natives were beyond restless.  \n\nOnce we got on the plane the real fun began.  Apparently a wheelchair bound patient had some sort of issue, forcing more delay as they decided that she wasn't going to be able to fly.  We were stuffed in like sardines and the A/C vents were barely blowing so folks really began to get uptight.  In fact, one woman pretty much lost her crap, got up, stormed to the back of the plane, barricaded herself in the restroom for a while while the flight attendants attempted to get her to be a little more cooperative.  She wasn't having any of it, and eventually stormed out and back to her seat, brandishing profanity and attitude throughout the cabin.  My son and I sat mesmerized, but many of the others on the plane became vocal as well.  Some were shouting in support, others in protest.  All the while the two male fight attendants tried to get her to comply to the captain's order for all passengers to be seated and buckled up.  Eventually she sat down, but apparently by then the police had been called because the captain came back on the horn and told us all that we now were waiting for the police to come help a passenger off the plane.  More cheering, some boos...much entertainment.  When the police showed up they removed the not-so-compliant woman from the plane as politely as possible.  Again there were some cheers and some boos.  \n\nThis all took about another hour. Needless to say people were ticked.  I've learned that it isn't good to keep people from getting their Vegas on.  These people had money to drink and gamble and Spirit was cutting into their fun time.\n\nEventually we got off the ground and the captain ordered up a free soft drink for everyone.  Mighty nice of him, right?  But who really wants a Diet Coke at 2 am anyway?  \n\nIt made for a long night, but a certainly interesting flight.  I've never been on a plane where anyone was kicked off before.  Made for a good story for my friends and family.  And, this afternoon I opened up my email to find an apology from Spirit along with a $50 credit for both my son and I toward another flight in the future.  Fortunately my son is going to college in MN in the fall, so I guess we'll give it another try in August.\n\nAll in all, Spirit is a cheap way to get from point A to point B.  I only took a backpack with what I needed for a couple of days so I didn't have to pay for a checked or carry on bag.  I let them randomly seat us to avoid the charge to pick my own seats, and they sat us together on both trips.  And I planned ahead with my own snacks to avoid paying for them on the flight.  We both flew round trip for $180 without having to \"join the club\" for a better price.  I thought that was a pretty good deal. I'm not sure I'd want to fly more than 3 hours because it is a bit uncomfortable, but I appreciate that Spirit makes the convenience of flight available for my working class rear end!", "user_id": "EvmGeJ7pz0N5z1zKymQCaQ", "review_id": "pPE4CiJ4XtGKD2SAJ8M58A", "cool": 5, "business_id": "dWFUKB_HPBIE87AFBHEb_w"}, {"useful": 2, "stars": 5, "funny": 0, "date": "2017-05-12", "text": "Have not been disappointed by this stylish vegan bakery.

This place is conveniently located near the area of town where I spend most of my time when in town.\n\nAdditionally, this is the place I started my vaping journey a year and a half ago. The venue itself is absolutely lovely. The ambiance of the lounge area is comfy, chic and trendy. The staff is nice and helpful. The store also has a TON of their signature Pink Spot flavor options and allows you to try some of them. \n\nSo, why only the 3 star rating? \n\nThe answer--I've upped my vaping game. I've gotten into mods and found a different line of liquids that I absolutely LOVE more than anything Pink Spot sells. I also have found that their mod selection is limited and overpriced. Out in the rapidly growing vaping world, there are better quality vaping mods & materials that aren't as expensive but that are also of better quality as the ones found at Pink Spot. Additionally, the quality of their juices has become mediocre, at best, given the fact that I have found another line of juices that, in my experience and to my taste buds, is far superior to those at PSV.\n\nI, admittedly, do still purchase a couple of their flavors. My Pink Spot flavor favorite is Black Mamba on the rocks. (\"on the rocks\" means with a hint of menthol). I also like their Frozen Lime Drop. Both are great flavors. But, I use them more of an occasional treat or as a mixer for other juice flavors.\n\nWhile I think this is a great place for beginners, I feel that experienced/serious vapers will outgrow this place. The liquids will become too sweet and syrupy, as they have for my taste. They are too heavy, which makes them less than optimal for every day, consistent vaping. (This also makes it less than pleasant to vape because the liquids tend to get clogged up in coils & other crevices of modified devices.) \n\nSo, while I think it's a nice store for beginners to chill & vape.

Laziza. The next week, I decided to join them in the debauchery of Makeout Mondays.\n\nLaziza is the epitomizes the all that a hookah lounge should be: dimly lit, DJ pumping out good music in the corner, a dance floor (which that night, was for vanity rather than for function), and a well-stocked bar with drink specials throughout the night. Our hookah had a mix of various tropical fruits (I believe mango and pineapple) and mint - boy was it smooth. I'm usually not a fan of hookah, but every time that hose came my way, I went to town. \n\nAs for the drinks, so many stipulations to the drink specials. My coworker was disappointed he couldn't partake in two dollar vodka drinks since they were for the ladies - a stipulation he'd like to dispute! Also, in order to get all of these deals on drinks, you have to order at the bar - a detail overlooked by our waitress when we asked her and subsequently ordered from her. However, I'll overlook the fine details, for this is the only place where the bartenders and waitresses know what a White Boy is. Having never heard of it, my coworker ordered me one - a Blue Moon, mixed with some orange juice and a shot of Amaretto. One of my favorite drinks definitely - I've ordered it elsewhere, but the proportions are never perfected as they are at Laziza. As the night progressed, my crazy coworker ordered a round of Lemon Drop shots. What a perfect way to end the night - that is, after some dancing and a few embarrassing photos afterwards.\n\nI now get the appeal of Laziza. Drink specials, dancing, and dim lighting leads to uninhibited actions, which in the case of my coworkers is both an excellent and dangerous thing. We left around 3 or 4, only to return to work at 6 - all of us inflicted with a terrible hangover and the desire to fall back asleep once we were off.

The music and ensuant dancing yesterday evening was typically corny, and the people on board were there for birthdays, bachelorette parties, and in our case, the 50th wedding anniversary of Kay's grandparents.\n\nIt sounds like the synopsis for a bad disaster flick, doesn't it? \n\nWe rode the river on a leviathan of good times and nostalgia called The Majestic, that with a capacity of 1,000 passengers, is by far the largest boat of the fleet. A beauty to behold, she has 3 decks, the top one being outside, giving one a unique perspective from which to see our controversial city (unfortunately, not everyone thinks we're as 'livable' as surveys suggest) as well as a way to get some fresh air. \n\nThe largely middle-aged crowd was in fact shakin' to tunes bashed out by a tight live band fronted by a short, greying man in a gold sequins jacket who was possessed by the spirit of James Brown, defying his age by falling to his knees and rising back up like a teenager sans a single bum note. He should be a star and was the apex of the evening's festivities. \n\nWhat else can I say about The Majestic?\n\n*The ride itself is so smooth, it's easy to forget that you're moving\n\n*Our Captain's Dinner Dance Cruise lasted about 3 hours. Shades of Gilligan's Island? \"A 3 Hourrr Tourrrr...\"\n\n*The buffet meal, which consisted of salad, prime rib, stuffed chicken breasts, and a few appetizers (veggies with dip, popcorn chicken, and breaded ravioli) was middling. \n\n*There's a bar in the back. Drinks can be ordered and brought to your table by a server. Some of the specialty drinks come in a special, keepsake cup. My non-alcoholic Captain's Orange Fizz (orange juice and ginger ale, shaddap) came in a massive, blue 50 ounce glass I suspect my mother will use as a  vase. Refills on regular soft drinks are free. \n\n*The staff is polite, enthusiastic, jovial, and appears determined to make sure you enjoy yourself, even if it's not your thing, and to be candid, I can't say it was mine. \n\nNot that it's an ordeal, but to me this is one for the out-of-towners and older folk. I.E. Take your parents or grandparents. If my grandmothers were both still alive, I can guarantee that they'd have had a grand time.\n\nP.S. I thought I used to harbor sufficient disdain for disco.\n\nAfter having been coerced into \"getting down\" by my date, that disdain is now even more profound. \n\nPillory that chintzy music, white boy. \n\nP.P.S. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know they have other kinds of bands gigging on the boats. Tim \"Ripper\" Owens performed on one with his Judas Priest tribute band British Steel for a Halloween show shortly before he became Rob Halford's interim replacement in the very band he was paying tribute to. \n\nP.P.P.S.

This is what I did not want to happen. \n\nStill, I went ahead with the cleaning.  3 persons, for 2 hours, $130 ($20 off for YELP).  I have a 2 bed/2 bath.  I live alone.  I don't use my oven, nor my stove.  The 2nd bath is not used and my office is a mess that only I can handle and I can't handle it.  So, they actually cleaned 1 bed/1 baths and one bath they wiped down and cleaned the tub which I never used except for when I take a bath.\n\nThe cleaning was okay. No fresh smell. The oven still should have been cleaned thoroughly even though I don't use it often.  There was some stains on the walls and this was not cleaned at all.  I don't want the frustration of explaining something to someone who does not understand me.  So I didn't.\n\nI think Prestine is for people who REALLY need cleaning.  My apartment is just not that bad.  My bed is made, there is no laundry to do.  I primarily need attention paid to the bathroom.  But not to the tune of $140/month or $120 every two weeks.  They charge by the hour so 2 hours will be no less regardless of how much they don't clean.  \n\nIf my apartment smelled clean and sparkled afterwards then maybe it would be worth it to me.  It was pretty much hit and miss.\n\n-adhered to requested arrival time\n-dusted the 2 ceiling fans and other areas\n-were nice people (I tipped them $15, $5 for each cleaner)\n-communication with office is lacking\n-wiped light bulbs in bathrooms\n\nWould I use them again?  I booked an appointment for next month.  I will probably try another company.  I am not impressed with Pristine.  The cleaning and customer service is just okay.  Not the quality I would present and could be proud of if this were my business.\n\nThanks Prestine and YELP for the $20 discount!  I don't want anything further such as, you don't need to call me about this post to make things better, I don't need someone to come back out to do anything.

We had a 7:00 pm reservation, however, I do not believe that a reservation would have been necessary. Things didn't start off too well, as the hostess tried to seat us at the banquet next to a gentleman at the next table who was fixated with the TV and had his butt blocking off half our table. When we insisted on another seat and pointed out several available, the hostess said \"I think we are expecting a table of 10 and need that space\". Well, alrighty then. \n\nWe did get a different table without an over hanger, but then it seemed to take awhile for our server to greet us.

We got shrimp fritters with spicy mango sambal. They were delicious but I thought they were a little stingy with the sambal. BJ got Jamaican jerk wings with cilantro cream.

BJ had the Tropical Paella. It was chicken, chorizo, shrimp, bay scallops, mussels, pineapple, roasted red peppers and sugar snap peas. I managed to steal a couple snap peas which were awesome. But BJ, who always cleans his place, didn't finish. He reported that the portion was plentiful, but he expected the dish to be a little more Spanish type flavored, rather than a jambalaya. Also, he thought was over seasoned, the flavors could have been a bit some subtle. \n\nFor dessert, we shared a single scoop of \"mystery\" sorbet. It was a mix of mango, ginger, lemon, etc. and after eating it, the rest of the flavors is still a mystery.

It comes with some salt and pepper on the side as well, but be careful not to sprinkle too much. \nOverall, chicken was very tender and crispy. The crispy chicken was a little too battered for my liking (like Popeyes crispy). But the meat was very moist and soft. The half & half also comes in pretty big portions. I think it can feed about 3 people (average eaters). \nThe sauce flavours (spicy & house special side sauce)  in my opinion tasted very similar except one was spicy. They both have a sweet kick to it. \nThis place also offers complimentary side dishes. They give you buttered corn on a sizzling plate which is pretty unique. And their coleslaw was surprisingly really good! \nThe only thing about this place is that it's quite small, not really good for groups. The whole place prolly seats around 20-25 people.

For a first timer, the other options such as the tikka vs korma flavor are a bit confusing. You can choose from three sauces which are mild mint, medium tomato, and spicy red chili. Afterwards you finish off with different toppings such as cheese, quac, etc. I tried the chicken tikka burrito and I would say that the flavors were spot on (basically a chipotle burrito with indian spices). My wife chose the masala shrimp. This was a big let down as the food felt luke warm to cold and there was nothing special about this dish (basically curry shrimp over rice). We did not end up trying the partha or the samosas during our most recent visit. Food was served quick.

She recommended two kinds of antibiotics for my treatment, since the seawater often contains more resistant bacteria like Vibrio. \n\nShe also recommended the Td vaccine for Tetanus and Diphtheria just to make sure no other infections could arise.

As mentioned in other reviews, it's a fast foody place. I would most closely relate the menu to Piada here in Cle - just a indian version. My biggest concern when i saw their menu before their opening, was that they would lose the indian flavor and spices and focus more on the creativity. Thankfully, this did not happen! Every dish, every chutney, every spice was so on point! YUM!\n\nI love the restaurant itself. Big, spacious, huge windows to the outside, huge glass panes dividing the kitchen with the dining area where you can observe the many chefs busy making samosas, naan, curries, etc. My favorite table is the large one in the front - if you look closely, it's crafted with books and the design in the middle are spines from all the books (the pages dangle below the table) - unique and awesome!\n\nI had the paneer plate - about 5 large chunks of paneer, fresh out of the tandoor, served on a bed of basmati rice with small cup of green mint chutney. The plate comes with two sides - a choice of whole wheat naan, regular naan, or basmati rice (didn't understand this since it comes on rice?) and a choice of tikka masala sauce, lentil soup, or chickpea masala. I opted for tikka masala sauce and whole wheat naan. I also ordered the samosa chaat. (YES, I ate a LOT of food!) \n\nThe paneer was delicious. Huge chunks, perfectly seasoned and in the tandoor for the perfect amount of time. I dipped each bite into the tikka masala sauce, which was amazing - had a bit of a kick and the perfect amount of spices. A bit tangy, a bit spicy - loved it. I only had a few bites of the basmati rice that the paneer was served on - not too hard to screw up rice, it was good, i was just focused on all the other flavors on my plate. The mint chutney was also really delicious! I like my mint chutneys a bit spicy and very tangy and that's exactly what this was - I actually used it moreso for the samosa chaat. Though the samosa chaat came with chutneys, the bulk of the chick pea/chutney mixture was on half of each samosa, so I dipped the other half in the mint chutney. Speaking of which, the samosa chaat was pretty good, as well - I could have used more of the toppings, but the samosas and the toppings were all still delish. \n\nThe only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the whole wheat naan- I only ate a few bites,- it was pretty dry and only a few spots were soft. I went with Andrea Z. and she got the regular naan which looked MUCH softer and not dry at all - I'll probably stick to that next time!\n\nThere's a hot sauce that you can get on the side (complimentary) - it is very spicy in my opinion, but very tasty!!

I did this after reading up and realizing that I would have to melt the tweeter speaker off of my old speaker cover and affix it and all the wiring to my new speaker cover.  (That's beyond my technical skillset.)  Oh, and all the fucking superglue that the hamfisted employee smeared all over my door frame and rubber door gasket in his horribly botched attempt to fix it?  I wasn't really able to get tall of that off, even with acetone, so thanks for the permanent super glue damage to my car.  It took me about an hour to figure out how to affix the new speaker and to razor scrape as much superglue as I could off of the car's surfaces and it still looks bad.\n\nI'm furious.", "user_id": "XMy-OTpVY8O1L-8w1zOKcw", "review_id": "r7fwKBj1EU_84cTVS-mTCQ", "cool": 2, "business_id": "x7vCsg5J68WGRdh4UrUGOQ"}, {"useful": 0, "stars": 3, "funny": 0, "date": "2015-04-01", "text": "This is a fun and casual place, but certainly not a place to go work on your game.
